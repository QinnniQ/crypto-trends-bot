I think of Ethereum as civilization scale infrastructure.
I think of it as a new trust foundation for the planet.
I think of it as digital oil or Ether's digital oil.
I think of Ether as the highest octane trust commodity that the world has ever seen that
powers transactions on this new kind of software, trustware, the Ethereum technology.
And so it's too big to describe with one metaphor, which is why we use all of them.
And yet, Tom Lee came out with this simple statement a few days ago, which kind of captures
it all and is really intelligible by the lay audience.
And he said, Ether is the next Bitcoin.
All right, here we are with Joe Lubin, CEO of ConsenSys and Ethereum co-founder on the
Defined Podcast again.
Joe, welcome back.
It's so great to have you.
Hey, Kamie.
It's good to see you.
Okay.
So I was very excited for this conversation with you and your dog.
It's adorable because I think you've always had a really important role in the Ethereum
ecosystem.
Alicia is one of the initial co-founders and then with ConsenSys, then recently you've
taken a new angle here with accumulating a bunch of ETH with Sharp Link.
So would love to hear your description on what led you, what's motivating you with this
strategy?
And if you can describe the strategy itself, what's the end game for SBET?
So our thinking started by just paying attention to what Michael Saylor was doing with the
strategy strategy, a formerly micro strategy strategy.
And he's just doing remarkable things.
His problem was that he had treasury assets that didn't retain their purchasing power.
He felt like he was fighting an uphill battle given that there's so much debt in the system
and the US government was likely to have to print lots of money and there's a long-term
structural problem developing.
And when we took a look at it, we figured, hey, we can do the same thing.
We can run his exact playbook in terms of the different kinds of financial instruments
straight up equity, common equity and preferreds and convertibles.
But Ether is a productive and yielding asset.
And so for all the Ether we purchased, that Ether would be put to work in staking and
restaking and DeFi and could be used to do what he's doing.
He calls it growing Bitcoin yield.
And by that, he doesn't mean he's earning interest.
It means he's growing the amount of Bitcoin per fully diluted share of equity.
And so his pledge and his strategy is all about just ensuring that if you have a share
of strategy of MSTR, then you will constantly see the amount of Bitcoin underlying that
and grow over time.
So we can do that, but we can do it much faster because we're taking in lots of US dollars
in exchange for equity.
We're immediately buying Ether and we're immediately staking Ether.
And so we don't use the term yield the same way that he does.
In the theorem, there's already native yield in different kinds of protocols.
So we've termed it Ether concentration, where essentially we pledge that or we believe that
through our operations, we will constantly grow the amount of Ether underlying each fully
diluted share of SBET.
And so that's a remarkable thing already.
And it serves a huge need in the Ethereum ecosystem.
The Ethereum ecosystem has been building for the future for a long time, and we think that
future is now.
And so in order to really launch us into the future, what we need to do is fix two more
issues that we have.
We fixed the scalability issue so we can now add horizontal and vertical scalability as
necessary.
We're doing a pretty good job on usability and we're going to be doing a great job on
usability as we get more AI into user interfaces.
We fixed affordability.
There's a ton of block space that's cheap at layer one and layer two.
And the US political system fixed the problems we were having as the United States of America
tried to make it really hard or impossible to be a blockchain company in the US or to
be a company and use tokens or be a company and issue tokens or be a company and use DeFi
or be a builder and build something, build a startup in the Web3 space.
That was not a smart idea to pursue, given that you're probably going to have a tough
time getting a bank account or be debanked if you get one or have the SEC chase you in
its inquisition of our ecosystem.
And so the builder stayed away and the company stayed away.
And that is all over now in a big way.
And our ecosystem is surging because of that.
But because of that, we don't have a ton of applications and we don't have a ton of users
in our space. We have lots of people holding tokens, but it's really crypto financial nerds
that are playing in DeFi, crypto art nerds.
We're playing in NFTs and even meme coins and protocol nerds are still building deep
infrastructure. And so we need the best and the brightest builders from the traditional
economy and Web to come in and build in our economy using Web3 primitives, which enable
people to build essentially up by and for the community rather than building in an adversarial
nature with your users.
And when we have the applications, we'll have many more users.
I think that'll really kick off mostly in DeFi.
And we're seeing TradFi recognize DeFi, explore DeFi and onboard itself to DeFi via these
treasury companies, via stable coins.
And perhaps most importantly, to really ignite this next phase of development, this next
decade of Ethereum is to get supply demand dynamics for Ether into a healthier form.
Because there's so much block space and there's not enough transaction volume, there
has been too much Ether out in the world. And that resulted in supply demand slackness
and malaise in the ecosystem, price drive sentiment.
And so we recognize that if we could raise lots of capital and start buying Ether and
if we could inspire other projects to do the same, that we could take lots of Ether and
lock it away in different protocols for a long time and really tighten up the supply
demand dynamics.
And so you're seeing that in full force right now and it's going to keep going for a long
time.
The other really interesting idea is that Ether and Bitcoin are really the only rigorously
decentralized protocols in the world.
And if you believe that the world is going to move increasingly on the path of decentralization,
then both of these are going to grow to be very, very valuable in comparison to where
they are right now. And stacking up big piles of what I think of as highest powered money,
decentralized money, uncensorable money, I think that's going to be an important construct
for the next economic super cycle, the next 80 or 100 years potentially.
Perfect. Okay. So the motivation summarizing greatly for SBET and SharpLink is to make
sure that the supply demand of ETH is such that there's more pressure for the ETH price
to rise. Therefore, just igniting this cycle of interest and activity and more buying and
innovation, because as we saw, kind of underperformance drives the opposite kind of, you know, just
skepticism.
Yeah. So it's a great business model. We believe long term money making business model. It
lights a fire under the Ethereum ecosystem and we're building a business that is accumulating
a huge amount of high powered money. And you have giant piles of high powered money. As
Berkshire Hathaway, they have giant piles of low powered money. You can do pretty profound
societally beneficial things with it. You can think of this strategy or this construct
as similar to what happened after Bretton Woods, where the US dollar was effectively
made the reserve asset of the world. And that created imbalances where the US was trading
paper, treasuries and US dollars for goods and services around the world. That led to
a structural trade in which US treasuries went up in price and down in yield for about three
decades. Similarly in Japan, the massive disinflation that they experienced after their boom led
to about 30 years of the Japan carry trade, where you borrow in cheap yen and you put
it in higher yielding assets. So those kinds of structural things in an economy can drive
trades or strategies that can last for a very long time. And I at least believe that this
decentralization trade will last for years or decades.
Do you have a target for the percentage of E outstanding that you want to buy or maybe
it's a dollar amount target that you're looking for?
So we're going to keep raising money and turning it into ether. And we're going to
keep deploying the ether in productive yielding ways. We don't have a specific volume or amount
of ether that we're trying to buy. We don't have a specific price that we would love to
see ether get up to. But if we think about it in terms of this stable coin phenomenon,
the United States is excited about our ecosystem because it needs to grow. So the US has been
trying to reduce expenses, but austerity is un-American. So that hasn't been working very
well. The US knows it needs to grow out of the debt that it's in. And in order to do that,
it will deregulate and it will make use of our technology because our technology can make things
much more efficient and effective. The US will try to weaken, has successfully weakened its currency
in terms of exchange rates. And it needs to do that in order to reformat trade imbalances,
make the dollar cheaper and its products more attractive. But the US also in its
effort to maintain political primacy, it needs to keep the dollar politically strong. And what
that means is the US can enable the world to dollarize. So many countries that are in
challenging economic situations where they have high inflation or tyrannical rulers,
rulers who financially repress or exploit their citizenry, those tyrants are going to be weakened
in their ability to exploit. And the people in those countries will be able to have access to
stable stores of value and maybe even access to the US legal system if they're transacting in US
instruments. Not sure about that. But so this entry into our ecosystem by the US is both
incredibly wonderful to see validating for us. It also perhaps represents a threat to our technology,
a threat to decentralization because all these stable coins are based on centralized institutions.
And so if there's a future administration in the US that doesn't like decentralization,
that prefers to control all aspects of life centrally, then our technology would become
very inconvenient. And so what we need to do is have decentralized stable coins,
like make or die or sky product that are CDP based or over collateralized based instruments.
But there isn't enough Bitcoin and ether in the world in order to support enough with that.
And so what we need to do in order to make the financial system more decentralized,
the DeFi system more decentralized is to grow the price of ether and Bitcoin enormously so that we
have enough decentralized economic bandwidth in order to operate at global scale.
That's a really interesting long-term effect of the rising ETH price. Of course, rising price
drives attention and builders and so on. But you're right that it also enables a truly
decentralized stable coin because the reason why make or die slash sky now started adding
USDC and centralized collateral was because it couldn't scale enough with ETH.
I hadn't thought about it that way. ETH price raising also enables more
decentralized assets by having ETH as collateral.

Going back to SBET for just a couple of questions. I wanted to ask you about what do you think makes
attractive for investors versus an Ethereum ETF, especially now that BlackRock and others are
filing to add staking to the ETF? Why would an investor buy SBET versus
an ETH ETF, especially when there's a staking? The ETFs will have lower yield and they won't
be able to stake all their assets. They'll only be able to stake in vanilla ways, so earn less
yield and they charge fees, so there'll be a fee drag as well. But they're good products
intended for different kinds of audiences. We'll have different kinds of investor types.
Retail traders will have convertible bond buyers that appreciate different strategies that they
can run with the fact that we'll have a pretty rich options environment around the equity.
Bond buyers are often pretty comfortable with 5% yield, but a convertible bond buyer would
benefit from seeing potentially much higher volatility or much greater upside.
Will you be deploying ETH besides layer 1 staking in DeFi, too?
Yes, absolutely. Currently we're doing it in vanilla, but we're working on plans to
do more exciting things. It's interesting to see
more large-scale use of DeFi in the works. The EF is doing that with its treasury.
You're going to be doing that with a sharp link treasury. It's good tailwinds.
Other things we can do because Ethereum is programmable is we can put some investment
contracts on-chain potentially. It's complicated, but there are a lot of projects trying to tokenize
public equities currently and that's really exciting. It's also potentially problematic
in some cases. Hester Purce has sketched a short warning despite being the major
saint of decentralized protocols. She's also saying, hey, wait a sec, there are some serious
issues that we need to take a look at. If we allow people around the world who aren't subject to
effectively to the US securities laws, it could put some companies into difficult positions if
they're holding large amounts of equity. It's doable, but we need to figure out how to do it
in a healthy way. We at Sharp Link Gaming are very interested in exploring what we can do in
terms of tokenizing our equity. One exciting benefit of that is that unlike in the current
environment where it's not easy to know that somebody holds a share of Apple or Nvidia,
because it's really owned by Seed and Company, which is owned by DTCC. You're getting
sort of arm's length ownership of your shares through this securities industry infrastructure.
What we can do is there can be equity in an SPV and we can give people ownership of a token that
controls a share in the SPV. Then we know who owns the stock effectively. Just like in the NFT
ecosystem, we can do token gated experiences or perks or something like that. It could really
change the game for public companies in terms of how they engage their owners and users.
That'd be really interesting to see and maybe easier to pull off from a regulatory perspective
than current equity tokenization experiments, because in the case of Robinhood, they are
offering derivatives of equity and not equity itself. But if you're like the primary issuer
of equity and the token, maybe you can just map them together more. Maybe it's just easier
to regulate that way than through a kind of a derivative. There are different ways of doing it.
You can just track the price movements and do contracts for differences and just make sure
people are getting paid based on what the actual stock does. You can put a whole bunch of equity
in a special purpose vehicle. You can have an arrangement where when people are buying tokens,
you're actually buying equity. When people are selling, you're actually selling equity.
That only works during market hours. You can combine some techniques. I think that's what
Robinhood is going to be doing a bunch of different things in order to make it all
work and feel smooth. It's really interesting times. Then the last question I have is on the
risks that this might pose for the ETH price going forward in the case that there is a prolonged
bear market or a sharp downturn. What's that? What risk? It's going to get too high?
Well, the opposite can happen, as we've seen. There is this concern if there's leveraged buying
of assets in a downturn, liquidations can turn a bear market or a decline in price and make it
even more pronounced. How do you see that playing out? If you're hoping to build an ether treasury
company that lasts for decades and has a giant impact on the world, you probably want to take
a very prudent approach to risk management. We're not levered at all currently, but we'll
probably do some things that involve small amounts of leverage. We will, I believe, never
get ourselves anywhere close to a position where we're forced to do something that we wouldn't
want to do. That thing would be selling ether, which is just not the worst thing in the world,
but certainly not the point. We will manage our risk and our leverage very carefully.
Great. Now we've talked about what you think drove ETH underperformance before with
right now not enough activity and usage and just a lot of cheap blocks or just a lot of ETH supply.
But you've also said that you expect ETH to outperform Bitcoin going forward and to even
potentially flip in Bitcoin. What do you think the drivers for this outperformance will be?
Well, the two protocols are very different. They have different use cases. Bitcoin has
one main use case and not, you know, people are trying to make other use cases possibly work,
but I haven't seen anything successful on that front. So whether it's lightning or layer twos,
a little bit of success in the Bitcoin NFT space. So Bitcoin is basically gold 2.0.
A lot of people feel like it's perfect and complete. It shouldn't evolve anymore. It's
going to have to evolve for quantum computing reasons and people are working that out as we
speak. So $20 trillion in gold. TAM is maybe their target audience and some portion of that.
Ethereum is, I believe, increasingly being seen as the infrastructure for first the future financial
system of the world. And then once that gets established, and that's really accelerating
right now, which is why you're seeing some of this run up, we're talking to nations and major
financial institutions who are understanding that, hey, they're unshackled. The SEC isn't
going to stop them anymore from doing innovative things. And so they're now able to execute
some thinking and planning that they've been doing for a few years. So TradFi is absolutely
moving to DeFi. It's coming on to DeFi. Beyond that, once Wall Street gets fully engaged,
so first financial institutions and Wall Street traders get fully engaged, and once Main Street
sees that, hey, Wall Street's all talking about these tokens, ether's going up in price,
ether races towards its all-time high, ether surges beyond its all-time high. Journalists,
we love journalists, especially when they say nice things about our technology. And they'll have an
opportunity to do that because things are going to get very energetic and exciting in the Ethereum
ecosystem going forward. We and others are working on social graph technology, decentralized identity
technology. And so once this first wave involving mostly DeFi and brings in lots of institutions,
enterprises, and people, then I think we'll have the incentives in place so that lots of great
builders start to build applications on decentralized protocols and decentralized networks of social
graphs. So we will become the substrate for the global financial industry, and we will move the
world's applications from web to walled gardens to the re-decentralized worldwide web. That's
why it's going to flip. That's the vision. It's going to massively flip the previous economy.
So the thesis is the time for Bitcoin is Bitcoin's use case is digital gold,
it has a 20 trillion asset, but Ethereum's target is bigger. It's the entire financial system,
to be a substrate for the global economy. And it's going to be a much more valuable global economy
than it is today because AI and decentralized protocols are going to drive growth. If we
think about decentralized trust as a new kind of thing, and it sort of changes how much value can
be created in the world. So the world currently operates under centralized trust, where authorities
imbue intermediaries with power and trust, and the intermediaries run systems of the world
by maintaining trusted third-party databases, which hold letters of who owns what and who has
what rights. And that is pretty good for building a society, but it's not really that good for
most 99% of the people in this society. So we can do better, and we now have the tools to
build a more decentralized world. So Satoshi Nakamoto had issues with centralization and
invented a new kind of database technology and invented a new kind of trust. Decentralized trust
showed us how to implement decentralized trust with a blockchain that enables anybody to
inspect it or anybody to use it or build stuff on it permissionlessly. And we've taken those
ideas and we built decentralized finance on it. And so we are now able to operate and govern in a
much more decentralized world. And that's going to enable all the industries of the world, all the
applications of the world to build differently in ways that are much more enabling for people
and communities. And that's going to, that plus AI is going to lead us into an economy that is going
to grow much, much faster than anything we've been able to do so far. And so if you think about trust,
what is trust? Hard to define. We've thought of it as a new kind of commodity, kind of virtual
commodity, where if you add the virtual commodity of decentralized trust to a transaction, to a
relationship, to a process, a set of activities, then that decentralized trust virtually guarantees
that they happen, guarantees that they happen fast and guarantees that the agreements in place
get done really quickly and you don't need a whole bunch of lawyers. And once you've had made an
agreement like that in a smart contract, Hey, anybody can use that really inexpensively. You
don't need to hire lawyers and have issues around it. You can take each one of those value creating
events and you can squish more of them into a unit. So you can effectively compound value creation.
The value of compounding is pretty enormous. If you're, if you're just growing on larger and
larger amounts of value, the TAM of Ethereum is not with this new trust commodity, this new highest
grade trust commodity called ETH. It's not just the size of the current economy. It's probably
orders of magnitude larger than the current economy because we're all going to grow very fast.
Okay. Two follow ups. In what timeline do you see ETH becoming the substrate of the global economy
and web? And what will the price of ETH be then? So it's happening faster and faster. We're still
a pretty small part of the global economy, but the paradigm shift towards bringing things on
chain is accelerating. And I just don't think it would be meaningful to give you a number
regarding what the price of ether would be. And it's obviously going to go up at various
stages of the parameter shift. Right. But like, no, no, like, what's that? What price do you think
it'll be in five years from now? No, no idea. I'm just a writer. You're, you're, you're the finance
guy here and the ETH accumulator. But I don't know, like for like back of the envelope calculations
for kind of this, like, you know, like financial system time, if you, if you go through kind of
that, like mental exercise, have you kind of sketched out like an idea of what that could be?
Yeah, we do some thinking about that. And the problem with doing that, people like to put
numbers on things. The etherealized people put together their excellent report thinking about
ether as essentially fuel or digital oil. And so they put some number on it,
maybe tens of thousands of dollars. We put together a really interesting thought piece
on Ethereum as trustware on ether as the highest octane trust commodity. So ether in that situation,
both powers transactions and storage on the Ethereum platform, but also if you apply ether
to any sort of activity on any of the Ethereum related networks, then it guarantees execution
and brings a lot more trust into the situation and probably adds a ton of value there. And so
we looked at some narrow situations and I think we got a range up to $20,000. There's a sort of
a bear case, bull case and mid case. So I think it's misleading though, because you're really
only looking at one sort of use case, one characterization of what ether does. What we
may end up doing in the second chapter of this work is take a look at all the different kinds
of business sectors there are out there and sort of guesstimating how much value, how much savings
we can find or how much value we can add to business activities in those sectors. So more
to come on that front. Okay. Look for version 2.0, which will probably have a chapter with lots of
numbers in it. Big numbers. Interesting. Big numbers, I'm sure. But for now like the
EKA range is maybe a ballpark. What if sending crypto felt more human? Pulse just launched
Red Packets, a new way to gift tokens with meaning. It's gasless, gamified and claimable
inside group chats only. Think AirDrops meets social cues on chain. Backed by smart wallet
tech and live across major L2s, Red Packets turned communities into micro economies of
gratitude and growth. No seed phrases, no friction, just connection with value. Check it out at
pulse.social. Do you think though that Ethereum will be the only blockchain to secure all this
trust and activity and transactions? Because maybe a risk to that valuation model is that
Ethereum is not the only one doing that. Yeah. I don't think anyone thinks that Ethereum will
be the only blockchain system in the world going forward and eventually. I do think that Ethereum,
because of its current massive lead, because the size of its ecosystem, number of developers,
amount of infrastructure, specification. I don't know how many blockchains have an actual
specification that enables teams to come along and build clients for their blockchain. Really
hard to do without a specification. And so if you don't have more than one client keeping the
network operational, then you risk one client having a bug and then your network stops,
which is not the kind of platform that you want to run critical global infrastructure on.
As you're aware, Ethereum cut its first block, its genesis block, July 30th, 10 years ago,
and has been running nonstop pretty close to flawlessly from a protocol perspective
for nearly a decade. So that's the kind of civilization scale mission critical infrastructure
that you can build an economy on. And we also need lots of different kinds of databases. We
need super high throughput databases like Mega ETH. Linea is going to run Linea Layer 2 technologies,
going to have some exciting characteristics, including high throughput projects like Solana,
Dosei, Swee, many others have valuable characteristics for certain kinds of use
cases. I think in the not too distant future, we'll start thinking about just building
applications. The applications will either sit on software development kits or operate
through AI agents and the underlying blockchain infrastructure will be less important. The builder
will pay attention to that and the builder will choose the appropriate kinds of database
characteristics in the different blockchains that will be necessary. The other consideration
is sort of geopolitical where the world is going to move on chain in the same way that
the world moved online in the 90s and the aughts. And so we're going to see nation states and
companies and business sectors, gaming ecosystems, either establish their own layer ones if they
don't need a ton of security or if they're willing to pay a lot for expensive security or building
on Ethereum, building a layer two on Ethereum layer one or building a layer two and layer
threes and layer fours. So if Canada wanted to set up a bunch of financial and governance,
civil infrastructure on blockchain, which is a smart and transparent thing to do, even voting
perhaps, then it would probably be best to set up a layer two to give all its provinces different
layer three as provinces can give layer fours to some of the subdivisions. So I think the future
of on chain online of decentralized protocols will be that there are geopolitical constructs
that we see with different kinds of networks and functional constructs where different kinds of
networks provide different capabilities. There's also just community stuff. So base is a bit of a
religion. Linea is a bit of a religion. Arbitrum is a bit of a religion. These are tribal things,
Ethereum, Bitcoin, et cetera, very tribal also. And so there will be that sort of social inertia
that probably maintains some divisions. Okay. So definitely a multi-tank future with a lot of...
But it's also, I think from the end user's perspective, it's just going to be applications
and we're gluing all this stuff together as we speak so that it works,
feels more homogeneous and works fluidly. So that's been a big problem for Ethereum usability
in the past and it's definitely become better, but still not fully fixed, I'd say. The layer one,
layer two interpretability. What's missing? What's going to happen going forward that
will make that feel more seamless? So we did this divergent phase where we had lots of
builders and researchers figure out how to scale a horizontal and vertically. That's gone well.
It introduced fragmentation. We knew it would. So the next phase is what we're in right now,
which is convergence, which is sewing everything together in interesting ways with the
intense base architecture, with AI, working across different networks, with solver networks,
and just taking intents and figuring out where to get the activity done on different networks.
SDKs will enable builders to just put different kinds of activity on different chains and just
fast communication channels being worked on across is a project that's driving a lot of that activity.
It's happening. It will accelerate. Another direction for the Ethereum ecosystem is to
really beef up layer one. And so that's happening in terms of increasing gas limits. It's happening
in about being worked on now, but probably launched a year from now. The Glamster Dam
hard fork where we layer one. One of the techniques for doing that is to enable
zero-knowledge proof pre-compiles. We'll have layer two infrastructure sitting inside layer one.
We'll still be able to have layer twos, but they'll be able to access
code inside layer one, which will make things more efficient and bring much greater
synchronous or near synchronous composability. So do you think that the end state of this is
a user will just come to an app, they won't know what's happening, whether they're using
Ethereum or base or linear, and any kind of transfer or communication between the
Ethereum layer twos and layer one will just happen instantly and the user won't even have to
worry about that. Is that possible? So the internet's been around for a long time. Web one
has been around for a long time. Web two has been around for a pretty long time. It all works really
smoothly. It works really smoothly because lots of technologists have taken unfathomable complexity
to then build it up in layers and made it all work smoothly. That enables a builder to think
about, hey, what sort of use case do I offer? How do I get product market fit? How do I make
it intelligible and satisfying or delightful to the user? And that's all great, except it was
centralized and it turned incredibly exploitative of the user. Many aspects of big tech have
effectively done things that are very destructive of the social fabric of the world. So yeah, great
technology globalized the world, but introduced some real problems. And the thesis is that, hey,
we want lots of those applications. We want them to be less exploitative. We want them to
do better things for more people, get people more economic and political agency. So how do we do
that? We have to build an entirely new information infrastructure for the planet and really a whole
new way of thinking about trust and governance around the world. Yeah, it's not a small feat,
for sure. The biggest transformation in recorded human history, I believe. So it's taken a few
years to get to this point. What we can expect is that pretty soon, a small number of years,
there are going to be a lot of delightful applications that give people much greater
agency, personal bank in your pocket that you really, it's based on decentralized protocols,
but you're self-custodying your own assets. And if you want to lend them out, you can do that.
And you can do that on decentralized protocols. So that's the kind of example that we should
expect. We should expect applications built on social graphs that you own, you control,
you can monetize, you can pay people for adding value to your different social graphs. And so
all of that is getting fluid. It's going to be less about which blockchain tribe you belong to
in the early years of blockchain development. And it's going to be about just what applications
or what decentralized organizations you choose to make use of in your business life, personal,
social, et cetera. So what role do you see Ethereum having in that future? Like for example,
do you think that there will be a certain set of applications that will be better suited
for Ethereum versus others? Or yeah, where does Ethereum fit in this ecosystem?
Ethereum will have a very big role. It'll have a foundational role. I think layer one Ethereum
is going to be the digital asset settlement layer for the planet. So big valuable stuff,
whether it's valuable assets that are minted and issued there, whether it's valuable protocols,
whether it's nation state or network state, political stuff like treaties and the big heavy
duty things. It'll be deep infrastructure, layer one, and some of the layer twos will probably be
deep infrastructure too. If the United States has its own layer two, then it's going to have to be
a really beefy thing and it'll have lots of subdivisions. And so I kind of think of Ethereum
as the central clearinghouse of lots of global infrastructure going forward. There will be many
new quasi-independent networks built, but it's not easy to get security to incentivize lots of
block builders or validators to run your blockchain infrastructure. And so why not
pay a little bit to Ethereum because you can inherit all the security guarantees of Ethereum
layer one by running an appropriately architected layer two. So I think it's going to be an economic
issue. I think the reason there are lots of layer ones right now is not because they're
really needed, but it's because somebody had a cool idea that might be a 5% improvement over
where Ethereum is right now or where it's going. And a VC figured, hey, I can make a lot of money
on this project and I'm going to fund it and we'll run it for a while and figure out how we exit a
couple years from now. Okay, so I guess the outcome for those VC chains... I'm not saying
I dislike VCs. We do a bunch of that work also, but I think that's the main driver for a lot of
these projects. Yeah, for sure. We see it a lot. I'm sure some of those chains will be successful
though, right? And somebody could come along with a spectacular idea that's 10, 20, 100x better than
what Ethereum is going to be anytime soon and that could win giant mind share. I don't think
it would replace Ethereum because the momentum that Ethereum has is giant and flipping so much
infrastructure and usage wholesale to something totally new is not the kind of thing that you see
in the economy normally. Ethereum has a huge first mover advantage as being the first smart
contract chain. It just got so much builder mind share. It does have that. That's just
impossible to replicate at this point. Yeah, there will always be Ethereum killers.
Yeah. The moment Ethereum was born, that was going to happen. All right. I just wanted to ask you
to wrap up. We've seen, I did it about this, how the narrative for Ethereum has really come back to
the first days of like the very early days of Ethereum, times at the Miami house, like people
were talking about the next Bitcoin, the world computer. So I've seen kind of the memes around
ETH just like really becoming more simple, more kind of focused, which I think is a good thing for
forgetting just like the broader public to understand what ETH is about. So to you,
what's your preferred meme for ETH? Is it like digital oil, world computer, next Bitcoin?
How would you pitch or how are you pitching ETH to like just like institutional investors or like
just like everyday people? Yeah. So we pitch Ether and Ethereum differently to different kinds
of actors depending on what they're interested in. And we can do that legitimately because
Ethereum is so much, can do so much. I think of Ethereum as civilization scale infrastructure.
I think of it as a new trust foundation for the planet. I think of it as digital oil or
Ether's digital oil. I think of Ether as the highest octane trust commodity the world has
ever seen that powers transactions on this new kind of software, trustware, the Ethereum technology.
And so it's too big to describe with one metaphor, which is why we use all of them.
And yet Tom Lee came out with this simple statement a few days ago, which kind of captures it all.
And is really intelligible by the lay audience. He said Ether is the next Bitcoin. Actually,
he said Ethereum is the next Bitcoin. It's pretty true in the sense of the impact that it will have
and the fact that Bitcoin is in its moment of mainstream acceptance because it has
a very clear use case. And Ether and Ethereum are just getting there. We're about to cross
the chasm into mainstream culture. Awesome. Okay. I think that's a great place to wrap up,
Joe. Thank you so much for joining me. This was a pleasure as always. And yeah, great to see
all the things that you're doing on Ethereum. And amazing to have this conversation just
a few days before Ethereum's 10th birthday. Have you bought a present yet?
Maybe I should just buy more Ether. Thanks again.
