DeFi Saver is designed to be an all-in-one solution for DeFi users, addressing key needs
such as swapping, lending, and leveraging. It goes a step further by providing advanced tools that
simplify and streamline the management of on-chain positions, making the entire process
more convenient and efficient. But DeFi Saver doesn't just aim to simplify decentralized finance,
it aims to redefine how enthusiasts engage with it. In this way, their goal is twofold.
Aggregate top-tier lending protocols to provide unified access through a single interface,
and create an additional layer of functionality and features not available in default protocol
applications. And last year was DeFi Saver's biggest yet, boasting record-breaking integrations.
Sky from the creators of MakerDAO, Euler, Fluid, LiquidEv2, and more joined the platform,
ushering in endless possibilities for users. So let's see for ourselves what this app is all
about. They have a comprehensive interface. DeFi Saver brings together lending, borrowing,
and swapping across 14 leading protocols and four EVM chains, including Ethereum,
Optimism Base, and Arbitrum. You can execute everything from simple swaps to complex strategies
like automated leverage management and loan shifting. It's far less intimidating than jumping
between crypto protocols native UIs. So let's try it out. We start by visiting DeFi Saver's homepage.
Log into the app using the button at the top right, or simply click the call to action at
the bottom. It's also helpful that they have a simulation feature that you can use to interact
with the dashboard before you even connect your wallet. So once our simulated balance is set to
100 ETH, we'll create a MakerDAO CDP with 30 ETH collateral and 100,000 DAI debt, at a two times
leverage. We review and confirm the transaction and voila, it's live.
Now let's check out the loan shifter feature. We're going to move our newly created CDP from
MakerDAO over to Spark. First, we'll navigate to loan shifter via the dashboard.
Select your position, choose Spark as the destination, and click shift.
Confirm the transaction, and it's done.
So let's talk about security. Last year, DeFi Saver integrated the safe smart wallet,
the brains behind Gnosis faults, as its default smart wallet. What does this mean? Your assets
get the advanced protection they need, along with 10 to 15% lower gas fees per transaction,
according to SAFE. The fact that over 10,000 SAFEs have been deployed post-upgrade speaks
volumes about user trust. And let's take a look at a couple of the advanced features.
With automations, you can set parameters to trigger an automatic boost, repay, take profits,
and more, just like in your stock portfolio. Taking it a step further, you can set the
leverage management and liquidation protection, allowing you to unwind your position or leverage
up when the prices meet your preset parameters. This feature in particular is really helpful for
harnessing the volatility of your crypto assets and for giving you peace of mind as you go about
your day away from the computer. However, I will note that the automations have a minimum amount
deployed, so not everybody can use them. So for mainnet, you have to set a minimum amount
of $30,000, and for L2, just $500,000. We also have TX Saver, which provides stress
relief for anyone who's had a bad swapping experience, which in crypto happens a lot more
than we'd like to admit. TX Saver shields you from MEV attacks, and if a swap fails,
DeFi Saver covers the transaction fees. You gain peace of mind that comes from knowing that you
won't face hidden costs or surprises. Now let's talk about the fee structure.
As far as the fee structure goes, advanced actions cost 0.25% plus an additional 0.05%
if that action is automated. For any simple actions that can be done on a protocol's native UI,
there is no fee. And DeFi Saver just launched the Discover page. They've announced the launch
of the Discover page, a new feature designed to provide users with an overview of all available
opportunities supported by DeFi Saver. This allows users to compare various markets and
stay informed about the changing conditions across different protocols. To access it,
open the DFS app and find it at the top of the sidebar. You'll see a layout of all options which
can be filtered by protocols, collateral, debt tokens, and networks. Whether you're borrowing,
leveraging, or yield farming for stablecoins, WBTC, ETH, or LSTs, the Discover page is designed
for all users, no matter their strategy or expertise. And no wallet connection is needed
to explore this feature. Our final thoughts? All in all, DeFi Saver nails the balance between
sophistication and user friendliness. Whether you're rebalancing a portfolio or executing a
standard swap, you get a seamless, secure, and feature-rich experience. I wouldn't necessarily
recommend this product to a newcomer to DeFi, as this platform is aimed at a more sophisticated
DeFi user who's more familiar with DeFi concepts. And there's not a whole lot of handholding or
explanations of the terms and risks. So if you're looking for a one-stop shop for all of your moves
in DeFi, DeFi Saver is for you. And for the more aspirational,
well, you can hang out in the simulator until you're ready to level up.
