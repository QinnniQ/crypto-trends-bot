Of course for most of the time I just assumed it was over and we'd have to figure out how
to wind it all up but once a lot of the chaos of it had moved into history I think we just
had so much support from people and I talked to the team and asked them what they wanted
to do. Do you people want to stay with us or move on or what do you want to do and everyone
sort of said oh well we'll probably stay in the industry and say okay what are you going to do
in this industry and say I'll probably work on well all our expertise is in this type of thing
so we're gonna have to work on this again and we just said oh well if we're gonna do that would
we work together again? Well yes, probably. Well do we need a new project then? It wouldn't be
weird if we just like collapse this one and started Euler 2 or something you know why not
just why don't we see if we can stay together and make a go of it and yeah we were fortunate
you know our investors and people were very supportive and said look we're ready to back
you again and support this if you guys are ready to go again so yeah we at some point we took we
yeah we just said let's let's go for it.
All right here we are with Michael Bentley co-founder and CEO of Euler Labs. Mike it's
so good to have you here on the Define Podcast welcome. Thank you very much for having me yeah
Yeah likewise so Euler has had a really fascinating story a comeback story you were exploited for a
huge amount of money in 2023 and now you've recently broken through a billion in outstanding
loans with you know up from less than 50 million last year so it's just been a really interesting
comeback so we'll get to all of that but I'd love to just start from the beginning learn more
of your background what led you to crypto and then what led you to start to found Euler? Yeah
my story I mean the first time I ever heard about crypto was probably 2015 and I was gonna I was
trying to do a side project with somebody I was a research scientist finishing my PhD and me and
a friend were looking for stuff to do and he told me about Ethereum I initially was a bit of a
skeptic I would say and so I kind of dismissed it and then I came back in 2017 there was a bull
run at that time and of course that grabbed everybody's attention it was all in the news
and everything I thought maybe there's something more to this so I got involved and started you
know downloaded Coinbase and everything and then started playing around really and there were at
that time there was primitive DEXs and things around there was Ether Delta and IDEX and I
started mucking around on those things and like learning how to code and like learning that you
know some of the code base and things and having a good time I built some bots and made some money
and lost some money you know just hacking around in the system and it was yeah it was really fun
but for the next few years nothing really happened and then in 2019 early 2020 I was working as a
research scientist doing mathematical modeling of populations and things and DeFi emerged or
like the early early foundations of DeFi started to emerge things like Uniswap and Compound and
they started to get me really excited I started thinking how can I build something in this space
so it really started with looking at Compound's code and their product actually and trying to
think of some way I can innovate on this and make it more open to different types of assets or you
know change the way that interest works and make them more decentralized so that's really how it
got started in my interest in the space and then from that I participated in a hackathon I met my
co-founder Doug who's a computer scientist by training we worked on on something together built
this primitive I guess what would have eventually become Euler for the submission in the hackathon
it went very well when did it win which hackathon was it so yeah shout out to ENCODE and there's I
think it was called the Spark hackathon back then so it was a collaboration of different universities
in the UK that were participating in the hackathon and yeah we ended up winning and then
from there I mean the pandemic was raging at the time right this was like 2020 you know and so
my day job I was kind of not doing what I was normally doing I would say sort of being asked
all the labs were closed down so I was at home I just had my daughter at the time as well so
spending a lot of time with her and so I had a lot of free time to work on this and
I got an offer from some venture capitalists saying would you like to turn this idea of yours
this hackathon project into a into a fully fledged business and try and grow it from here
so what was the initial kind of innovation of that hackathon project so we had two things one I think
at the time a lot of the early lending protocols were focused on just lending and borrowing of a
handful of crypto native assets but there was a there was a lot of tokens emerging around that
time you know a long tail and so one thing was can we extend what compound are doing and extend
it from you know four or five assets and make that open up lending and borrowing for for all
the assets you know how can you collateralise anything and use that as to take out loans so
that was one of the challenges we want to to address the other one was I was you know I did
do a lot of sort of maths by my day job I suppose and I had this idea about using something called
control theory to see if you could make interest rates set themselves without having to have some
central controller coming in and pushing buttons like we have with central banks you know setting
the interest rate manually over time I was curious about could you could you just let the system
itself set the interest rate and make it more decentralized I suppose and so that was yeah quite
a interesting intellectual challenge at the time yeah I've always been curious on on why or I guess
like surprised that that that maker actually kind of decides on its interest rates yeah I for some
reason like when I first started looking at maker and everything or so much of it is automated but
not interest rates so I think that's an interesting problem yeah it is I mean maker is more like the
central bank in a way and I think it is kind of hard to set you realise when you get into the
weeds of it that it's really hard to make interest rates work in a self-controlled automated manner
it's somewhat easier on lending protocols where the interest rate is guided by how
what percentage of the pool has been borrowed and effectively you can in that scenario where you
have like a finite supply of something and you say what percentage has been borrowed of that finite
supply turns out the answer is that you can let these things set themselves you cannot automate it
and decentralise it more there are obviously trade-offs to doing so and you know there's some
nuances there but it's it's definitely possible and you know Euler's Euler has had these kind
of interest rates they're present on other money markets as well but when it comes to maker I guess
the key challenge is that there's no finite supply of DAI or you know USDS as it is now
right and that that means targeting something it's sort of like yeah that lack of a constraint on
that supply makes it harder I would say to set interest rates so yeah so the the key thing like
the key innovations that you were you were working on are the long tail of assets a lending protocol
that allowed for that and a more like market-based like automated way of of setting interest rates
and so okay so you took kind of these VCs up on on their offer and yeah and went and built it
yeah that's right and then and then the rest is history as they say I mean that was in September
or August 2020 really at the the heart of DeFi summer as we called it back then obviously
everything there was just explosive growth in the industry around that time lots of projects
launching and we were we were one of them that sprang out from that period I suppose and
and then eventually obviously you go to market and you you change things and you know our goals and
ambitions changed quite a lot as was as we started to as I think all of all of you one went live in
2021 sometime and yeah then you get feedback obviously from the market itself and people
users and so on and things uh yeah definitely definitely changed in terms of priorities but
that was the original ambition I think interesting okay and then I guess like there's like to me like
the phase one of of Euler which is like since launch and then up until the exploit yeah can
you go through um yeah like how how the protocol developed in that time like you mentioned like
some of the priorities changed yeah and then and then how big did you get like right
before the exploit yeah I mean whenever you bring I guess any product to market you meet you then
start getting real user feedback and we definitely got plenty of that I think I mean the early days
one of the ways that we innovated was by to enable lots of assets to be listed we wanted to work on
top build on top of other permissionless infrastructure in DeFi and that was you know
one of the big innovations around that was Uniswap it was a version two of their protocol
and they enabled people to you know create swaps for any type of asset right so you've got all
these these countless pools emerging and what's interesting about that is that then from those
pools you you understand the relative value of assets and from those relative values you can
then potentially use those the pricing to enable collateral debt relationships to emerge a lending
protocol on Ethereum you were on you want to guarantee effectively that your collateral is
always worth more than the debt if that's never if that's not the case then there's no incentive
to repay so you have to be able to price the the collateral in the in the in the loan and the debt
in the loan and make sure that one's greater than the other and that the pricing is accurate and
fair we thought it would be cool to use Uniswap as a pricing mechanism for for collateral debt
relationships and I would say it worked it worked quite well for for a time but we realized of
course as we brought it to market that there are subtleties to that Uniswap prices you know can
be manipulated by bad actors who try to inflate the price maybe they want to inflate the price
of a collateral so they can borrow more against it than they really should be able to and that
kind of thing so there's a lot of learning around that time about you know a lot of experimentation
DeFi I suppose about what worked what didn't and yeah we launched with these Uniswap
based pricing systems and then over time I think we moved moved away from those and tried to
use alternative pricing mechanisms that were more robust I think I wrote some research articles
about how these things could be manipulated and like looking at the like extreme scenarios how
much money it would cost that kind of thing so it was a lot of sort of security analysis off the
back of just you know this whole new system and figuring out how it works it was also apparent
as well we just kept getting feedback from users that wanted different kinds of things we realized
that lending and borrowing is a very complex space with lots of different design directions
you can go in you know some people want low risk low yield opportunities other people want more
exotic opportunities that maybe where they take on more risk but the yields end up being higher
some think people want things isolated some people want things that are more permissioned
or permissionless you know there's just a huge design space there and I think all of V1 as a
whole it was built around just this you know one type of idea and realized there's so many more
ideas out there that people want so yeah we started to try to build you know to think about how we
might design a V2 of the system in terms of how it went as a protocol it was it was it was much
loved I would say we launched in the competitive marketplace with the lending and borrowing
protocols around at the time obviously compound was one of the things that we had most admired
that was that launch was doing very well so Arve had kind of become more prominent around that time
but yeah Euler kept growing and I think going into the exploit
in 2023 I think the total deposits were at their peak maybe 700 million
there were lots of interesting events before that before our exploit in DeFi that helped
dampen interest in DeFi I suppose there's the Terra Luna thing and FTX and all these others
and so I think by the time of the exploit total deposits were around 400 million
and that was yeah that was that was in 2023. So can we get into the exploit?
So the exploit was one of the biggest in DeFi it was almost 200 million lost so how did that happen?
Yeah it's a very long story but the short of it is obviously Euler we were known as a team
that built things slowly we took our time we got lots of audits we had the largest bug bounty for
a lending protocol in the space at the time so we took things very seriously but
even after all those audits we got a bug bounty report from one user a long time before the
exploit happened suggesting that there was a way to front run the very first deposit into a brand
new pool and you'd be able to maybe take more funds from that than you should so one user
would be affected by this per pool and it would be the first user potentially it actually turned
out to be a common kind of exploit that with the other protocols were you know maybe vulnerable
to as well and it's considered a something that you should fix a high because it's a loss of funds
so we got this bug bounty we paid it we were grateful we went to our auditors and security
partners and said you know we've had this thing this thing and they said okay let's let's deploy
a fix so we came up with this solution which was effectively to prevent the front running we would
the front running was caused by a lack of an exchange rate that wasn't initialized basically
when the new pools formed and so we thought well if you want to initialize an exchange rate
let the very first depositor they will deposit like one billionth billionth of their asset
initialize the exchange rate and then their main deposit will happen so effectively donate to the
reserve some that's what the function was called donate to the reserve some some assets initialize
the exchange rate and continue anyway that that fix was audited it was deployed and the protocol
then continued for many months after that unfortunately what we weren't to know at that
time what we missed was that the new function that we'd introduced donate to reserves opened up
quite a sophisticated vulnerability in its own right which would be the cause of the of the
the critical vulnerability which allowed far more assets to be you know stolen so it was very
unfortunate circumstance ultimately somebody figured out that you could you could use donate
to reserves in a in a sort of clever way along with the liquidation system so that you would
lose money yourself by donating to the reserves but you would gain an ever so slightly more amount
of money through an alter through another account that you were using so one account one you would
have two accounts one account would be losing money one account would be making ever so slightly
more money than you would lose but if you loop that and it's a compute you know computational
system you just loop it and and take advantage of that that discrepancy and that's that's
effectively how they were able to take all the funds from oiler by using this donate to reserves
function that have been introduced many months prior i'm sorry to have to you know ask you to relive what must have been
i don't know probably the worst time of your life but yeah um i can't imagine how how was kind of
waking up to or like like finding out that that your protocol was being exploited by by this
amount like like yeah like how did you find out uh it was i mean it was horrific the timing couldn't
have been much worse to be honest my my son was born uh on on the thursday late late thursday night
and um over that weekend we uh the whole industry was blocked by this dpeg of usdc so over the entire
weekend i spent the weekend not with my son but handling a bunch of work stuff because usdc was
dpegging which obviously is a significant event for you know for for the whole industry but also
you know mainly lending protocols so um everybody was on high alert but by sunday evening it appeared
that usdc was going to be fine there was some kind of agreement made and uh yeah monday morning
i woke up uh expecting uh to start my paternity leave my wife and i were looking forward to
spending time with with my son and uh my mum came around to the house to take my daughter for the
day and go take her out and you know give her a nice time and it was about it was nine o'clock
and so she was in my mum was in the house just literally about to take my daughter and i heard
my security alarm going off my first assumption was of course this will just be the usdc thing
again i thought it's probably read its head something's happened in the night a deal's
fallen down i was like okay it was you know alarming but i was thinking this is this is
probably going to be okay we just need to you know work through this and i went up and just of course
the first message i saw was was that we were being exploited and uh and so yeah it would be um
that's that's how i found out it was true very very yeah how shocking awful yeah um and was it
like was like the 200 million just like disappeared or or um was it like something that was like
continuously being drained like could did you were you able to like even try to stop it at the time
or were the funds just gone no it wasn't instantaneous it played out over several
minutes i would say so it was over a short period of time and interestingly you know i can't get to
the technical details here but some of that time actually then then gave us clues as to maybe who'd
done it and what's happened there was like just there was clear flaws in the execution plan of
the exploiter because if they could have taken it all in one go they would have done and it turned
out that that process had failed but unfortunately it happened still happened too fast for anybody to
do anything really about it and the um and then what proceeded after that of course was
when a protocol has been drained uh of many of its assets but not all of them there's then a big
scramble of course for other people to try to uh try to get value out that's remained any value
that's remaining so there wasn't just an exploit when these things happen it affects lots of
positions and parties and everything and so there was a lot more that then followed on from that
which uh yeah which played out over another maybe another half an hour or so it was uh
it's very chaotic but it was it was impossible there's there's no obvious solution at that point
to you know when when the half the half more than half the assets in the protocol have gone
there's these ones remaining and it was it was it was pure chaos oh my god no i can't imagine

after that i i think um as i understand the the uh the hacker actually returned some of the funds
like how how was the process of like trying to recover funds like figuring out what had happened
who did it like negotiating with the hacker yeah so we um collectively as a team we started to
immediately build um build a picture of you know bigger picture as we could about potentially who
might have played a role in this right um i think by the end of the you know by the end of the first
day so by that evening we probably already had like 10 10 to 15 potential candidates so we did
a lot of analysis like as a team we all split up and got as much data as we could from a variety
of different sources both on-chain data off-chain data looking for any evidence we could find about
who might have played a role in this uh trying to find signal and amongst all this noise
and um and yeah over the course of the next three weeks then we uh three to four weeks i think it
was um we a lot of crazy thing a lot of crazy things happened uh we ended up having lots of
red herrings people that we were convinced would be you know guilty of this but but then turned out
not to be there were people that had forked the protocol and spent a lot of time on certain areas
of the code for instance that you know and then they were deleting stuff on their profiles things
that were just looked very suspicious but turned out to be you know red herrings um yeah they
exploited themselves i mean they they they were you know behaved a little erratically and there
was turns out to be interesting signals in the early like i said in the early phase of this there
was it was carried out with less efficiency let's say than it could have been and so we could
decompile the attack vectors and start to get an indication of the type of attacker this was
we knew we knew early on that it probably wasn't you know north korea uh they're one of one of the
people that you you know prime candidates whenever there's a big attack you know people
expected possibly then so we knew quite early on that probably wasn't this was more likely uh you
know an individual and obviously there's a lot of information you can gain from that and it raises
the prospect of catching the individual getting the funds back um at some point they yeah they
started to i guess try to launder the money and that you know somewhat unsuccessfully and then
they started to attract the attention from other bad actors in the space i would say who were
seeing them as a bit of a target and through a variety of um yeah through a variety of different
means we managed to establish contact with the the person uh and even at that point though that
it wasn't things weren't very promising because they still kept trying to play lots of games at
one point they pretended there were different people involved and yeah but uh yeah i i managed
to talk to them personally um at some point and um so you know who it was is it public uh it's
public yeah i'd say so at this point i mean it was yeah there's a that they like they later
introduced themselves uh yeah i mean uh i i don't want to name name name the person but i mean it's
it's out there if you if you go looking uh yeah i mean was it someone from your team no no no no
definitely not um it was uh yeah it was a young man uh who had uh yeah a history in uh computer
science i suppose and was you know a young man that was interested in very interested in exploits
and things i was from talking to him i gathered that he he was he was like an admirer of people
that carried out exploits he found it kind of exciting and exhilarating and uh and uh yeah found
the opportunity on oiler and uh i think he's it was hard to to discern his motivations i would say
honestly he was an interesting character um but yeah i mean managed to thankfully managed to
establish contact with him and over time build some kind of um trust and a weird relationship
with him i suppose and uh yeah we just had lots of odd moments um at one point i was in uh i
thought i was gonna have a heart attack because i was just i was just so worn down i was just
getting absolutely no sleep and i said to my wife and my chest feels really tight yeah it was just
like awful so i went to the i went to the hospital just to to get checked over and everything i was
sat in the waiting room and then he started messaging oh my god and i'm sat there in the
hospital waiting room on a laptop like you know my laptop i also had like very little battery as
well like trying to message this guy and then it was just the most insane moment there was i'm like
literally on this laptop and then the an alarm went off because somebody else in the room next
to me was going into cardiac arrest and i just like literally never insane moment wild i was just
like this cannot be real what's happening right now but then he was he was going through his own
like he was questioning his own actions and motives and starting to to turn and so
yeah he was he was also feeling i think uneasy and unwell about everything and so then yeah i was
just trying to talk to him and try to humanize the situation find some common points of uh
common points of uh you know agreement between us and then yeah for several weeks later uh in
dribs and drabs and with some wild events in between um he eventually ended up returning not
not just some of the money but basically all of it we got 240 million back out of
200 around 200 million was stolen and uh but he'd converted he'd converted the stolen funds into
eath and eath happened to rally at that time so so you got more back than when you're reading
so around 40 million more back and he didn't keep anything he did keep a little bit um he had some
funds which were um which he'd already laundered which were hard to hard to retrieve um yeah how
much he made yeah probably probably a few few million dollars okay uh but the protocol itself
had its own funds in there so effectively they were the protocol's funds protocol lost more
lost more money and just took all the took all the loss so anything that was returned was given
back obviously all to the users oh that's amazing i didn't i didn't remember that you had recovered
more than he took in dollar terms yeah i mean it was complex right it's it's just uh he just
turned it all into eath like it's a common strategy for an attacker because it's a more
of a permissionless asset it can't be frozen and such like so that's why why he did that i suppose
but um yeah i mean in he in the intervening period just lots of weird and weird things
happened there was you know suspect that was turned out not to be true and it turned out actually
he was from the same town as the guy that had done it so there's lots of on there's lots of signal
wait you you were from the same town that no no there's another another another person
someone else that you suspected yeah that was was also from the same region and uh there's so many
crazy points for a long time we didn't you know didn't know the identity of the attacker and we're
having to sort of work through negotiations with them not knowing whether we knew and we didn't
know if they knew and there was just this lots of game theory involved but in the end i think it's
remarkable that okay you once once you found out who it was that it was more like just like a
personal relationship between you and and him and um and just you know trying to get to to his like
you know like more human side and and get some empathy and compassion and you ultimately achieved
it yeah i think so i mean he he was a very complex person i don't know whether how much he empathized
with the situation from he would swing sometimes between showing a lot of empathy and other times
would be then asking now i want to keep all the money or i want to keep like a large sum or
he would say you know start to pretend that there was other people involved and like
start to move money to other wallets and be like ah somebody else took that
so he was a very complex complex individual and uh it was a really really tough uh negotiation
lots of complex messaging and uh yeah it had to be navigated very carefully i think one thing he
did which was uh incredibly strange uh but but maybe in the end was actually helpful was he
donated some of the stolen assets to a known address that was associated with north korea
that had been identified by u.s agencies as links to those i suppose that was kind of a bluff it was
like oh look it's probably just lazarus or however but of course we we sort of knew already that
that almost certainly wasn't the case and so that bluff gave us more information and so on from
throughout helped our investigation but then what it did do as well is it then alerted uh
some other people to then start messaging him and start sending him messages saying we can help you
launder the money but we could see those messages and we were able to say you know start to work
with him say look those messages are not your these aren't your friends right you are in a lot
of trouble here if you start interacting with these other people like we're we're the best way
probably got super scared i hope yeah i think so yeah i said like i hope i hope you realize we're
we're the best way out of this because there's no other good angles here you are going to be
uh yeah and under you know living a very stressful life so what was the deal was he
he kept a couple of million gave back all of all of the rest and you didn't call law enforcement
that's um effectively yeah that's what he was asking for i mean uh you when you do something
like that obviously law enforcement are involved and um yeah there was a lot of interest in this
particular case from from various various law enforcement agencies so yeah but um yeah i mean
we just said ultimately like what everybody wants from this is that you just give the money
back once you do that then this becomes much less interesting from everybody because we've
everybody's got stuff going on in their lives they just want the money back so we just kept
reiterating that point over and over and over again uh and uh yeah and working very carefully
on his emotions and our emotions and everything and yeah eventually it it's yeah it happened but
there i mean the there's just there's so many even wilder weirder things in in this story that
just played out in the in the midst of it although interesting characters that showed up claiming to
take credit and and you know all sorts of weird stuff happened yeah we'll get into into all the
details in my defy book yeah you can write an entire book about this yeah it was it was just
bizarre yeah um and so did how did you manage to um refund all of your users
um yeah i i mean it was uh just use effectively like common accounting techniques and try to
try to calculate what's called people's nav you know net asset value at the time of the exploit and
a return based on you know relative to nav effectively because you know the assets came
back there was some i mean yeah i really can't the amount of times he like split the funds up
and converted some to die and then some to usd so it all came back in in in weird ways and um
yeah obviously took advice on on from um took advice on what what you do in this circumstance
because uh there are lots of options you can go down they all have trade-offs you know some people
like oh go buy back the assets on the market it's like but they've all changed in prices since then
you know and uh there's no easy way there's no perfect solution that i would say it's a very
complex thing but yeah just try to follow best practices and uh and then opened up a claim page
for um for people so that they could go and put their their address in we developed the tech for
this really quickly the team worked incredibly hard during that period we were working just
non-stop to get this up and running as fast as possible um because the whole time once the funds
came back of course the markets are volatile and imagine if eath had just like tanked dropped
90 percent of something it'd be devastating right so it's um it was really really tricky
very very hard and the post exploit that that period lasted several weeks but then there was
all the all the all this stuff to process there was all sorts of other things you know legal
elements that played out over many months after this so it was it was incredibly complex i'm sure
you can yeah i can imagine yeah um so okay in that time as kind of the the fallout from from
the exploit yeah what were you thinking would happen with euler like did you did you always
know that you'd continue or were there times where you thought okay this is done uh no i mean i just
thought it was done yeah for a long period yeah of course yeah i mean it's uh i spoke to spoke to
you know friends family investors people you know in the industry i got we got loads of support
from people in the industry giving advice on what to do and and giving us support and um yeah for
i'd say for of course for most of the time i just assumed it was it was over and we'd have to you
know figure figure out how to how to to wind it all up but once um yeah once all once a lot of
the sort of chaos of it had sort of you know moved into history i think um we just had so
much support from people and i talked to the team and asked them what they wanted to do do you
do people want to stay with us or move on or what do you want to do and everyone sort of said oh
well we'd probably stay in the industry i said okay what are you going to do in this industry
and say i'll probably work on well all our expertise is in this type of thing so we're
going to have to work on this again and we just said oh well if we're going to do that would we
work together again he's well yes probably well do we need a new project then do we it wouldn't
be weird if we just like collapse this one and started oiler two or something you know why not
just why don't we see if we can stay together and make a go of it and uh yeah we were fortunate
you know our investors and people were very supportive and said look we're ready to back
you again and and support this if you guys are ready to go again so wow yeah we at some point
we took we uh yeah we just said let's let's go for it we had so many ideas and so many cool
things we've been building that just were totally underutilized oiler v2 was pre-planned before any
of this had happened because of all the things we'd learned you know from from as we discussed
from going to market and hearing feedback and stuff so yeah a lot of all that was already
pre-designed or like in a you know early phase of development i suppose and uh we just thought well
why don't we why don't we give it a shot crazy um how much like how much time passed
from the exploit to when you decided to launch v2 months probably um yeah there was there was
even some discussion of course of like just launching v1 again some people were really
encouraging that because the the protocol itself was excellent and the incredibly the the
and and very frustratingly the fix to this exploit would have been a single line of code
it was a single missing check in in this in this function we mentioned donate to reserves it's now
kind of famous that that was missing so adding that that single check would have um would have
ultimately made the protocol safe again so some some some discussion around that but then we just
we just said you know if we if we launch v1 again then we're still
well we won't we won't have as much time to work on v2 and and tackle all these other interesting
problems and i think everybody was obviously exhausted and felt like spending some time
going back to just coding and not having to not having to have you know public facing thing was
was probably probably for the best of everyone i think we need everybody needed it so it's like
a turn of a page yeah it's like okay well yeah it's always hard to to to deploy a new protocol
when you've got an existing one anyway so i thought we all agreed like why don't we just
work on v2 and start there and we knew it would take many months of of work and everything to
to get that live and indeed it yeah it did it took probably even longer than we expected but
yeah it was i don't know three four months after after the exploit that we we started
in earnest on the new project i'd say and when did you launch v2 september uh last year i think
yeah and yeah and and now it's already at a billion it's a billion active loans it's got
about 2.25 in total deposits yeah it's been uh yeah i mean most of that's come from the
turn of the year as well so the first few months were incredibly difficult nobody
was that interested actually on launch we were so excited because we thought thought we spent
so much time on anything we were so proud of it and uh we thought the tech was incredibly
incredibly strong and um but of course it's really hard at that time everybody's doubting
everybody's saying yeah nice try but it's you know we appreciate the effort but it's not going to
happen that was kind of the consensus and we got some feedback as well that the new product was
maybe it was a bit more complex and uh the ui needed some tweaks and things so
the team were i would say the yeah the morale was a little low during those first few months
but um yeah i encouraged everyone so we've got to give this a shot so we we fixed up the
the feedback we'd got and slowly but surely things just started to change and what do you
what do you think prompted kind of that that change in direction where like people were able
to trust you again or at least like were incentivized enough to use euler i don't know really i mean it
was there was probably like a collection of things i mean all of e2 is built in such a way
that other people can build their own it's built as this kind of developers kit i suppose for
building credit markets and now dex markets and things so what it rather than being a product in
its own right it's just like a kit for building products and um in the in the first few months
we just really couldn't you know we couldn't persuade people that it was worth building
products with um so yeah we tried to showcase that and develop a few things and just like work
and the kind of development business development side i suppose and going out and like just meeting
people and showing people yeah you've got a problem here that you can't solve but euler
can solve it for you and i think once we once once we had a first you know first few of those
kind of things emerging then it became apparent oh there's stuff you can do with oil that you
can't do with other platforms and there was that that that early sign of just real product market
fit emerged who are like the main builders um a variety of people i mean this is curated that we
call them risk curators because typically they they connect together the components of the kit
and they make either very simple credit markets or sometimes more complex ones the simplest ones just
look like uh uh simple collateral debt pairs and they can either be immutable or some of them are
governed and have you know compliance checks and other things they are wrapped around them there's
these hooks and things other ones look almost like mini instances of something like rv i would say
they're a bit more complex they have more assets in included them more you know variable collateral
types um but yeah some of the some of the bigger curators um there's there's re7 and uh and gauntlet
and um k3 and mev and apostro there's a yeah one of the bigger markets was built by another team
called usual there's all sorts of people and they all build for their own reasons and we're kind of
we try to be agnostic about um about the products because that's our point our the whole point of
euler was to build the infrastructure and then let people be creative we we often don't understand
the the wants and needs of the market it's very there's all like as we discussed earlier there's
just many many different opinions about what a credit market should look like and what what
services people need and uh our goal is to just build the infrastructure that enables all of those
to be satisfied but we rely on other builders i would say to come in and develop their own solutions
build their own bespoke uh products for particular communities and user types and things so there's
a very wide variety of things being built what if sending crypto felt more human pulse just launched
red packets a new way to give tokens with meaning it's gasless gamified and claimable inside group
chats only think air drops meet social cues on chain backed by smart wallet tech and live across
major l2s red packets turn communities into micro economies of gratitude and growth no seed phrases
no friction just connection with value check it out at pulse.social
i think your strategy is very similar to morphos um yeah there's some similarities there for sure
yeah how do you differentiate between them i think we we have a similar philosophy at a very high
level in that regard um they're also kind of an infrastructure play trying to build and it's it's
lending and borrowing as well i think um in terms of why we've managed to to to find a niche is we
have different opinions on how those things should be uh designed morphos uh morpho i guess prioritizes
simplicity above all else and there's obviously an elegance in simplicity and it um there's something
i think quite nice about that euler's kit i suppose our like infrastructure play is uh it's
built around um enabling things to be flexible and so that means that if you want to build simple
things with the euler development kit you can you can go in and build morpho style markets
but if you want to build something more complex like an rv style market you can also build that
and so it's that flexibility i think that differentiates us most is you can build morpho
using euler's kit but not the other way around um yeah and uh and with that that's probably where
you know people come to to build things on euler that you know the the markets don't exist say on
something like rv and they can't build those things on morpho so they they then they then
come and use r kit and try to try to innovate themselves and build different types of products
i suppose and that's that's that's the main differentiator i would say um right now the
defy lending market is um at a near all-time high in terms of deposits around 69
billion so what what do you think will spark the next wave of growth will will it come do you think
like it's it'll be more institutional players coming and and building on on on defy yeah or
maybe defy's not ready for that yet and and will continue to be more crypto native
no i mean i think you you hit the nail on the head that it's definitely going to be institutional
plays i think there's a lot of um web 2 interest uh fintech interest traditional finance interest
in uh in in building on defy and use or at least using defy rails and the the technology we've
developed because it's more efficient because it's more transparent it's more composable i think um
yeah the lots of these things are lots of these the people coming into the space are finally sitting
up and taking note that there's actually something very cool about this um in the early days it was
it was mostly crypto natives the main use case i'd say for lending and borrowing markets was just
people would deposit eth and they borrow usd and they they wanted to do that because maybe they
wanted to they didn't want to sell their e or some people wanted to speculate on the price of e so
they then use that usd to to increase their exposures and that was the main use case and
so like lending and borrowing markets would be very um cyclical in terms of their deposits they
go up and down and it was very correlated to the the sentiment i suppose in the wider market i think
that's changing a lot um yeah the technology is now being used to provide um to provide a
wider range of like products and satisfy different user needs so say and a lot of those are
more related to stable coins and obviously the surge in interest in bringing stable coins to
market and in defy uh but yeah it's like we're getting a lot of calls and a lot of interest
right now from from some significant uh players in more of like a fintech space i would say than
than the traditional crypto native types yeah well interesting um so
uh yeah because when we talk about institutions it can mean from exchanges to fintech to
traditional banks and yeah so you're seeing that interest at least from the euler side
from like web to like traditional fintechs yeah i'd say that that's probably i mean obviously we
we saw the bobbin thing yesterday um i think you're going to see more more a lot more companies
that the record very recognizable fintechs moving into the space and starting to utilize
the technology that will probably be the first wave and i think with some of the regulatory
changes and like warmer environment for that and um you know it's now more of a regulated industry
especially you know in europe um they've made progress there there's some some signs of progress
in the us on the regulatory front i think yeah with that you'll then start to see also more
adoption for more traditional um you know traditional types as well in traditional finance
like banks and things i think will be more open to to adopting the technology yeah so we've
obviously spent uh most of the time talk about uh your your lending protocol but you also have
a dex yeah and you recently launched a stable clean product so if if you can
you know like bring all those things together and and and kind of describe your
your like bigger vision for euler yeah i think um i think the the earliest products in
you know or protocols in d5 tended to be uh tended to be quite inefficient and that's been one of the
criticisms i think from from people outside is that yeah it's kind of cool but it's still very
very inefficient one example of this is you know when you put when people do deposit assets into
a traditional you know some of the older versions of uniswap the assets just sit there and they
they're used very unproductively until a swap happens when the swap happens then they earn some
fees and so on but it's just very very unproductive to to deposit assets and just leave them sat there
if you've got usdc sat around that's not servicing swaps it should be it should probably be earning
yield somewhere and of course in traditional finance nothing works like that right they don't
literally when you have order books on exchanges and the assets aren't literally sat on the order
book they're sat in some some other place and things are where they're productive and then
things you know the the accounting son afterwards in retrospect and things are distributed moved
around of course um all this what aims to address some of the major inefficiencies in uh in this
exchange markets by operating on top of the lending and borrowing platform so that the
lending borrowing platform is the foundation for oil swap and by default assets earn yield
optionally earn yield i should say in a in the lending and borrowing platform first and foremost
and then if swaps happen they use the liquidity is used just in time to service those swaps so it
operates a lot more efficiently a lot more like how how exchanges would work in traditional finance
to give you an example of just like some of the scale in efficiency we've we've not even launched
the product yet i think there's only three million dollars in the pools but oil is already by volume
someone showed me yesterday with those three pools and three million dollars it's doing
as much volume as uh it's the fourth biggest exchange on ethereum already oh wow which is
pretty insane uh scale up in capital efficiency the other big innovation in oil swap which is
something that people have been crying out for for years since i very first entered the industry
was that when you when you deposit assets into the decks is another way to make them more productive
is to basically borrow against them to basically collateralize your deposits in the decks because
it's a valuable asset and then use that so that you can you know borrow against it maybe you want
to hedge some of the risk or you want to borrow the asset and borrow something and then use it
in another opportunity somewhere else or or reinvest back in and create deeper liquidity in
the pool itself and because oil swap is built on top of the lending protocol if the assets you
deposit into the into the vaults are in vaults that allow collateralization of those assets you
get that functionality natively out of the box and so people can borrow against their deposits in the
swap protocol and use it for a variety of use cases yeah so with with with extra lending and
borrowing uh yield um and this just-in-time liquidity function as we call it uh oil swap is
is vastly more capital efficient than any kind of decks we've seen so far in defi i think and uh
yeah gonna be very excited to see that that growing uh interesting okay so it's like building
different defi primitives that kind of fit and like work well with each other like yeah it's uh
in the in the early days we used to talk about composability and money legos of yeah you know
it would be it'd be you know rv and uniswap integrating and that's obviously worked somewhat
well in the past but it's it's actually quite clunky you know you end up in some ways um you
know i used to really really be a huge advocate for this kind of thing but it adds extra like risk
points because the two protocols weren't necessarily designed to fit fit together so you can maybe
maybe fit them together but you know when people have tried to borrow against lp tokens in the past
those lp tokens are kind of it's a little bit risky i would say to price those things and to
figure out how to collateralize them and it's a little inefficient to move them around defi
between protocols you might end up paying fees on multiple platforms at once and so on and um
yeah this is this is composability and but it's a it's it's you know coherent composability between
two things that were designed to work perfectly with one another built by the same team and
hopefully with that we get more of an efficient and effective and secure market um okay and to
to wrap up um just you know going back to your your whole comeback story yeah um yeah wondering
kind of what some any lessons or advice that you'd want to share with founders going through
something similar um i mean there's there's just never you there's always more you can do on
security and just obviously you uh you just have to keep pushing always do do as much as you
possibly can that goes without saying uh i mean we've always always advocated for that but it's
a very very difficult industry to build and you are very exposed the code is public and so on and
everybody's still learning about honestly what the best practices are and that's something we all
collectively have to keep pushing towards so first and foremost that's the most important
but i think in terms of you know when you do face trouble i've spoken to a team recently i just
tried you know sometimes get calls from other teams asking for for this advice and
yeah i give them the same advice i was given there's a friend of mine uh
lawrence from wildcat uh had an exploit many years prior and he said you know this is
explained about all the difficulties and said you know time is a great healer uh so take time and
breathe and speak to other people because uh yeah the it's a very difficult industry to work in but
it is also a very forgiving industry and there are lots of great people here that were there to
support you and uh and everyone knows what a challenging environment is so talking to other
people and taking your time with things i think is really important um yeah and you just have to be
really tough and really resilient because it's it's not it's not going to be nice but uh yeah
nothing worth doing is is ever going to be easy because if it was somebody else would have done
it already right so that's part of part of life i think awesome well michael any props to you for
doing the hard things and pushing through um and yeah i think it's a really inspiring story seeing
how you know you you you now kind of are are bigger than you were before the exploit yeah thank you
so yeah congrats on that and thanks again for joining me this was fascinating yeah thanks for
having me appreciate it
