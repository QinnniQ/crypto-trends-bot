Dude, like, I don't mean to, like, overstate it, but, like, it is, it is, I think it's kind of
historic. Today I sit down with the team behind a brand new crypto movie, How the World Went Ape.
This is a giant, like, Hollywood production company that is, like, coming to the blockchain.
Like, it's a, it's a huge event. A wild documentary that tells the story of the NFT boom and bust
through the eyes of the NFTs themselves. And this is a unique opportunity for people to actually
own the content. This doc is being tokenized on the blockchain to allow actual ownership. You know,
instead of buying a DVD, whatever, 20 years ago, and putting it on your shelf, you're buying
something which actually will increase in value. Watch today's whole video as well as follow the
link down below for an exclusive opportunity for you. We mentioned we're giving away Ape, right,
which is huge for, you know, one lucky person who, who buys a copy of this. And to get on the
whitelist, click the like button if you appreciate opportunities like this. Again, somebody is going
to win a Bored Ape. I wanted to be somebody from the Altcoin Daily Army. Thank you to the
movie for partnering up today, making this interview possible. And let's start, Jeff,
with your background. So I run a virtual productions. We're a production company
that lives in the Fremantle family of productions. Fremantle, you know, from things like American
Idol and America's Got Talent, but also things people don't really think about, like feature
films, like last year's Oscar-nominated film in many categories, Poor Things. And then we are
sort of the nonfiction documentary branch of that in America. So we do everything from long-running
series like Deadliest Catch to feature-length documentaries. We have one about Dan Rather.
That's on Netflix. We had another thing just happened on Netflix this past spring about the
Oklahoma City bombing, which was hugely popular. And so we, we play in that realm of nonfiction
series and documentary films. That's awesome. And Sharon, you in Hollywood pictures as well?
Actually, so I'm the director of the movie, but my background is writer, producer, executive,
startup, CEO. I'm the super weirdo of the group. But yeah, my background is producing a ton of
movies in independent studios. I was an executive at a network for a while. I've made some big hit
shows like You and Unreal, some big scripted series. This is my first time. I've done a lot
of writing. It's my first time directing. And so it's a, it's a big step forward for me.
And it kind of was born out of, I was CEO of a company called Mind Show at the time.
So we did the animation and I directed the movie and it sort of brought all of my weird interests
together in this movie. Well, people in crypto are going to love this movie. If you were at all,
have ever heard of Bored Apes? I saw the trailer. I loved it. Before we talk about that, Josh,
some people in crypto know you, but for those who don't. Yeah.
Yeah, for sure. So I'm the CEO of a company called Stuff.io and we have another company
called Book.io. And so, you know, we work to put digital media on the blockchain in a truly
decentralized way. So working with these guys, like it, I mean, like my opinion cannot be
understated. Like this is a giant, like Hollywood production company that is like coming to the
blockchain. Like it's a, it's a huge, a huge event, huge event for us, like as a, you know,
company. But then I just think a huge event for the space and, you know, getting out into
non-crypto people's hands. Cause there's a lot of people that are curious about
NFTs. Bored Apes is a great way to like explain that. And I think just what's happened even in
the last couple of weeks, like every, the market's just, just booming, you know? So it's a perfect
time for a lot of people, I think that are going to be curious to, to see this.
So stuff.io tokenizes books, movies, you know, stuff puts it on chain. That's never been more
relevant in crypto. I want to pose this to the group though. Why is today, why is now the right
moment to put Hollywood on the blockchain?
Goat, you want to talk about it from a Hollywood perspective?
Sure, absolutely. Yeah.
So one of the things that I think we at Original Productions and Fremantle, right,
Fremantle is this big global, you know, company. There are global labels across the world. We make
programming for all audiences across the world. And I think as we look at where media is headed,
connecting with audiences in a variety of different ways is going to be the key to sort of
being able to, to, to continue to create content in the future, right? There's streaming, there's
broadcasting cable, there's the internet, there's YouTube. And I think this is the next evolution,
right? And this is a unique opportunity for people to actually own the content, right? For creators,
it lets you have a direct dialogue with your viewers, right? And that's, I mean, I don't
sound like really like hearty farty here for a second, but like that's kind of the purpose.
That's why we all get into this storytelling in the first place, right? Is to tell stories to
people. And this is just a direct pipeline for that. The second thing is, as we looked at this movie,
you know, as you mentioned, it's about the Board Apioclub and it's about that journey, right? It's
also about the journey of crypto in general. And Sharon has a really unique perspective on that,
she'll share as we get deeper into the conversation. It feels native to this film as well. This doesn't
feel like a film that you would take to a film festival, maybe right off the bat, right? This
feels like let's speak to this community. There's a vast community of ape owners, crypto, the crypto
community. So let's go to them first and let's talk to them first and let's get them to see kind of
we're speaking to them later. Maybe we can window it out into like a streaming play or airplanes or
whatever. But it is just the right time. That's where we're all headed, I think. Yeah. And I think
just from my point of view, you know, I was in the space. This is my experience of authentically,
I was setting up shows with NFTs, token-gating. I was in to burn down the system and find another
way to make cool stuff. And so the movie is my story of doing that through the point of view of
the NFTs themselves, because who's better to tell the story? And so it's all real. Everything in the
movie is real, but it's for the community. And Jeff and I, when we made it, we were like, hey,
we want to authentically go to the people who will love this first and who will get how excited we
were about the space and how much I love NFTs. And then Josh had the tech where we could actually
pull it off. So it's sort of converged in this moment of like, oh, this will be pretty punk rock
to go right to the community and do this. And they'll love it the most. I also think-
Now, yeah. Oh no, I gotta totally interrupt me, Hasler.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Now do it. Do it.
Sorry. I also think, again, these guys are the experts, but I also think it's like a really
unique opportunity as a consumer of media to sort of have, you know, instead of buying a DVD,
whatever, 20 years ago and putting it on your shelf, you're buying something which actually
will increase in value, right? You can sell it. You can rent it to people, you know,
because it's yours, because you literally own it on the blockchain. This is more of an investment
in content rather than just like, I bought this movie and I'll pull it out and I'll watch it
sometimes, which is really cool for content creators to think about their narrative art in that way.
It will increase in value if the movie stays relevant in five, 10 years,
which is just to have that option, ownership as an individual. Like I love The Hangover when I was,
you know, in college and watched it. I was like, oh, and I bought the DVD. I don't own it. But if
I was one of those people that said, oh, this movie's hilarious, I think it will be relevant,
then the community builds around that. And I understand what you're saying.
As we talk about all this, Sharon, you're the person I want to ask next. For the folks at home,
what is this movie about? Because I watched the trailer. I loved it visceral reaction from me
because I lived through the rise and followed the NFTs. Not that they can't come back of the
board apes. Oh, they're coming back, bitch. Yeah. What is this movie about? Yeah. I mean,
this movie is really my experience of, of being in the optimism and the joy of the space, everything
from like, we're in pandemic, crazy. What are we going to do? We found this new world of NFTs.
It went up fast. It came down hard. And I think what I was excited to share in the movie was the
joy and the fun of the space. Like I had the best time hanging out and talking about what we could
accomplish. The crash was was pretty rough. But I also see that it had an impact this moment
on politics, on pop culture, on everything like that we hold as American. It like kind of ended
the NFT ended up leading from like a bunch of dumb digital apes who are going to change the world to
like actually changing the world and crypto being in a whole new place. So for me, it was like what
started out as like a fun bunch of bros being stoned turned into this like bigger movie and
this bigger celebration and moment and optimism about where we're going. So Sharon did so well to
she's such a great storyteller. She worked so hard on this. This literally this movie
is kind of entirely sprung from Sharon's head. And what's cool about it is it isn't like watching
frontline. You got a sense of this from the trailer. This is like South Park, punk rock,
comedic. You know, it is it the tone of the movie and the way Sharon wrote it and cut it and put
together really reflects the kind of punk rock nature trying to do. I wanted to be fun. It was
fun. I had a good time and I wanted to share that and I wanted and I want people to laugh.
Let me get let me give you my quick my quick take on because when they so we have a shared
shared ownership. So Bertelsmann owns Fremantle like big massive media conglomerate in Europe.
They're they're one of our our investors. They connected us and then when they sent it over,
I thought this is going to be a film that makes NFTs look bad or something right or just you know
pokes fun at Borde sort of just like that whole movement and like and it's not it's not geared
that way at all like really at the end of it like what you kind of conceptually understand is like
the the it's a what happened in NFTs was like a direct result of you know I think partly like
kind of was happening from a society perspective and she brings in a lot of stuff that's like
current events stuff like it's not just pure NFTs it's like what was happening in society like
through COVID and through like everything that was going on and like it's it's very like well
done and when you walk away from it you're like well like you understand these these online
communities in a different way and what it was really trying to facilitate was bringing power
to a creator is what like the fundamental underlying thing right is like how do how do we
you know empower creators how can creators like connect directly with their audience
and yeah it's it's very it's it's it doesn't make it look bad at all actually you end up thinking
like man you know everybody should really go join the board a community because the ethos is
a very positive pro creator kind of mindset my biggest problem with this is that I don't own a
board ape I feel I was too late even though they have dipped now but the cool thing about this
is anybody has the opportunity if you get a small ownership in this tokenized movie entered into
a contest to win a board ape can you guys elaborate yes let me make one little distinction so
you're not yeah you're buying a copy of the movie right so what we're doing is there's 10,000 of
them so it's not like ownership like in the actual you're not like received it's not a security or
anything like that like when you get it basically what we what we invented like our core technology
is a new file type that we refer to as media token so it allows us to take and completely
decentralized and that works for non-fungible or for fungible media the the same it's all you know
stored in decentralized storage and tons of shards and it filters in so that so you actually own a
copy of that and so we're the initial sell there'll be 10,000 of them and there's a white
list so we can talk about like how to get on that too but 10,000 initial and then later we're going
to come back and do like that that first 10,000 will be kind of a collectible edition then we're
going to come back and do a broader like you know like a standard release that will be a
that will be fungible based media so easy to get in and then yeah like you said like if you buy
one of these 10,000 we're going to actually give away a board ape to one random lucky winner huge
well the floor the floor price went up in the last week so i mean it's
did yeah it went up quite a bit so yeah it's getting more and more valuable because they put
out a new roadmap and the trailer came out which i assume changed the entire
board eight yacht club i mean i'm assuming and there's a link down below for the audience if
you want to check out the trailer check out the white list i want to pose an even bigger question
to you guys right now because this is i know there's been like there's qualities things that
have launched on stuff for the past year year plus many years but this is one of the biggest
that i've seen in terms of what this could mean for a changing industry movie industry
specifically i have to imagine the hollywood studios are taking notice and they're pissed
or are they on board how do you think this will disrupt that
josh i defer to you on this one i mean i'm i'm excited well i feel like our
our interaction and the interaction we're having in the industry isn't that the the studios are
pissed because the studios aren't making any money right there's like a there's a fundamental
problem in digital media that has existed since really since file sharing started and then there
was napster and everybody was sharing stuff and so that's when digital licensing came in
and digital licensing basically means that none of us own any digital media right like i don't own
any any ebooks that i buy i don't own any audiobooks or movies or music or any video games
right like if i said like hey you know you got a digital video games send send me send it to me so
i can play it it's like you can't because you don't really own it what you bought was digital
licensing right so this in just the last year really there's been a huge like sort of you know
groundswell of you know there's a new law in california that just went into effect at the
beginning of the year that makes it illegal to not disclose that you're that you're not actually
selling the person that thing and now there's like a class action lawsuit against apple for i think
it's like five billion dollar clash like class action lawsuit against apple because they um on
on the digital book side and how they were selling stuff and not disclosing that so like
digital licensing has basically sucked all of the the revenue from all of these production houses
and taken all of that and put it in the hands of like basically you know four or five mainstreaming
platforms and they basically have full control over the whole industry none of us as consumers
own anything and that's where you know inner blockchain and like the you know these types of
solutions so it's like we can actually allow them to monetize their the things that they do directly
to their audience and have a direct relationship so now they could come back and say hey if you own
this uh you know first version then you you know the you know if there's follow-up content or if
we or if it adjoins to some other thing right if we came back and said we're do something with like
america's got talent or something we could offer a discount to anybody that owned this asset in that
ecosystem right and there's a whole bunch of different ways that i think that web 3 marketing
is going to change but ultimately it brings a ton of revenue back to these production houses who are
you know struggling which i'm sure you guys could you know talk more to that
mm-hmm yeah i think i think kind of what i was alluding to at the beginning there's
we we in the production community have to sort of be flexible right some things are great to
take to a studio and fund that way some things are great to you know we're going to make a low
budget you know a youtube cool thing something like this where you can take something that of
the quality of this movie of the budget level of this movie and go directly to a revolutionary
new way of distributing your content is um we're i think we're kind of at the forefront of that
right and i think that's what the promise of blockchain and web 3 is all about and so i think
we would be as as as creators we would be remiss to not pursue these kind of new avenues and to
what josh was saying you know if you stream you can stream a movie you can make something you
can stream it and it sits there and it's it's waiting for you whenever in this model it's yours
you own it and you have a direct dialogue with us and and so again we may find that like down the
road maybe there's bonus content that we can we can put out to enhance it maybe there's new content
maybe you know one of the lead characters is an ape named jed um you kind of saw in the trailer
you'll see him in the trailer i don't know does jed end up having a podcast like if enough people
clamor it's a way for when i say like to enter into a dialogue with our viewers this is exactly
the point of it it's like oh my god you love the film enough people said like we got to see jed do
x y and z we can make that happen i hope it freaks out the cds that'd be cool
to jeff's point i can understand the studios in the audience this gives a deeper connection
because it's like instant access and if you're a true fan of whatever movie in this case the
board eight movie or a true fan of the board apes then the studios that has instant access
to that audience and that audience has instant access to a movie they love art they love if
there's auxiliary things around them yep totally i think you want different things right i went to
see superman this weekend right giant screen great movie loved it uh but it's something different
than maybe what i want from the board apioclub film right and something different from what i
want from my favorite creator on youtube and that's different from what i want of my favorite
streaming series and i just think the power is really in the consumer's hands to to pick
and choose the experiences they want to have and this is just a new experience that i think is
going to become really really powerful as we as we continue down this road again somebody is going
to win a board ape i wanted to be somebody from the altcoin daily army linked down below before
we get too far josh would you just remind the audience of like you know what who what is stuff
backed by and in the pedigree in the background for sure yeah um you know so we started back uh
you know really on the project in 2021 um we realized you know i had worked in the in the
publishing digital publishing world and realized hey we could actually use these tools and what
was happening with nfts and and and tokens and combine them with sort of industry standard
drm which is digital rights management which is like the ip protection around it so that
only the person that owned it had access to it and it wouldn't be like token gated content would
actually be like fully decentralized so our first uh investor in actually was mark cuban and uh he
came on early in 2022 and then we um we had ingram content which is the world's largest book
distributor um burtelsman's arm their digital media investments arm uh and then most recently
charles hoskinson who was the co-founder of ethereum and cardano so we've been very strategic
in like how we've sort of built out the um on the investment side to like really focus heavily on
on you know the media and distribution and uh technology and really like a lot of it was
just like how can we apply this new technology in an enterprise way right to really bring uh
how do we really bring in the normies right so like everything we do is geared towards that
right so even this film you can buy it uh with crypto but you can also just buy with a credit
card and if you don't know anything about crypto you don't have to set up a wallet like it'll
we can use we have a self uh uh directed system that will automatically set up a wall in the
background you're not writing down seed phrases all that sort of stuff so really it's like how do we
you know um not fully you know just web 3.0 but like web 2.5 right like how do we use this tool
as like infrastructure um to onboard these giant industries that have massive audiences and have
digital media that they could sell um to to their fan base but in a way that feels very natural but
then they they get the benefit of hey i own this and i can like jeff is saying i could i could resell
it or i could loan it to a friend or i could give it to my you know somebody in my family like
opening up all those opportunities with the the media that we that we all don't currently own
i think for sharon and me i don't want to speak for you sharon but so you but but one of the
things that was important to us was the whole normie aspect the whole like you can buy it with
a credit card like yeah you don't we you want it to reach as wide an audience as possible and
the technology stuff io has makes that possible for us well that's part of the movie too there's
a lot of fear around the language of web 3 and nfts and crypto people are you know they think
it's not for them and there's no reason for that and the whole movie that what i want is like
explain things like a wallet is a wallet it's just what you think it is it's where your stuff lives
like it doesn't have to be so complicated and that there's a lot of opportunity and fun and
a new way to do things and be disruptive and so like let's just bring people into it instead of
having the language alienate them and i think that's where we're all aligned is like let's
just go do something new like why why let this stop you just because you're afraid you don't
understand a piece of it like come on in like let's go just because you're on that point sharon
if you don't mind austin one of the things i think is i love to hear sharon talk about is like why
did you want to make this movie like the genesis of this movie kind of the style and and the story
i just you know maybe tell folks kind of why because you spent yeah i mean i was making this
movie yeah i mean i was in the space awesome i was in the space i was running like a metaverse
company i was talking to the crypto punks i was talking to apes i was talking to stoner cats were
in the movie hollywood crossover i was trying to figure out like how could i take my skills making
content and sort of bring it to this nft space and i just saw this potential to go straight to
the just like what we're doing and i got excited about it and i also saw a lot of people burn out
you know go crazy uh and take drugs and abandon the country you know i saw like all sides of it
man and i just like had this story i wanted to tell with my co-founders and the people around
me who were so excited and then so disappointed and then the scc came in and a couple of the deals
i was doing if i'd closed them they would have been coming for me and i was just like holy you
know like i lived this thing in this time and i got it i got to tell the story of watching that
market crash and watching everyone freak out you know um so the story needed to be told it needed
to be told and so everything in it's real like you've got everything an animated ape says it
happened man i mean there's a couple things towards the end that are kind of comedy but like
i i just wanted to share that experience and like my hope is people like you watch it you're like oh
i remember when ohanian showed up at nft new york i remember like i remember these people coming
into the space and what it meant you know for all of us who were like this is going to change the
world um it was you know it was a moment you had to live to understand it and i'm hoping to share
that and people i want people to watch it together and like have a screening and found and enjoy it
you know because it was pretty great and is the only way i can watch this movie is if i buy one
of the token collect collectibles that's the only way that's the only way that's it i gotta get
call me but like you know i mean we're close but uh but yeah man that's the way to watch it and i'm
explaining that to people and again some people in my space were like are you kidding and some
people are like that's rad like but this is a good way to like this is what it was supposed to be
this is what i was trying to build you know and the community right again yeah i don't want to
sound like a broken record but i do really believe for me part of the education for me in making this
film is getting to know the ape community and getting to know that like they're still together
and they're talking to oh yeah they're a real community and so the idea part of why we we
self-funded this movie for this very reason to be able to not have to worry that if there was
spin-off material or derivative material that we had to go to a third party so like if the community
wants it we can create more content we can release more content you know again it's that dialogue
between you know utility argument we were having is like what do you what do you get that's
different yeah now and how do you gamify and how do you engage in a way yeah i kind of find like
movies like this or moments in time where this type of thing could totally change the trajectory
just like the internet did back in 1999 or whatever of movies and film and much more but
in this case movies do you think a movie like this could ever be up for an academy award or
like is that not the path like like honestly it's movies like this that usually get the
attention i like you a lot now like i like you already but now i'm like pretty much crushing
hard on you i want it to like rip through everything and do all the things like let's go
like why not it's it's a different point of view that's what we're trying to do is shake it up
we'll see i mean you know there's a lot of resistance against this space too it's not
like hollywood's like yeah nfts that went well yeah they're not they're kind of freaked out so
everybody's like what are you doing um and i'm like come see it check it out so anything but
you said it here austin let's make it true well i want to get a collectible and hopefully this
movie stays relevant and then it'll be worth a lot i'm hoping i'm hoping i mean it's interesting
one of the things that's interesting about staying relevant is because because sharon's tech that
enabled us to bring the apes into our world because that's what i love most about the movies
yeah it's not there they they're telling a real story in our world and it's as if they live in
our world right it kind of goes like it's kind of of the moment like it's not like we finished it
eight months ago like we finished it like a couple weeks ago because we were able to continue
because the apes are able to comment on things that are happening in the culture
because the apes you know you know were able to write their commentary they act like the greek
chorus if you will it's pretty much of the moment like it's pretty current it is it's it's it's very
current and it's um uh it's it's just it's extremely well done like i think the response
from hollywood i'm what i'm hoping right is like you know this thing sells out and like that
that story of hey we actually launched something to a community it it sold out like it's like
really uh i think gonna shift a lot of opinions in hollywood what haven't we covered on the movie
on stuff io anything well i'd be remiss to come on altcoin daily not talk about my altcoin so
that's really what you're having you know we do have a drop of the movie we should probably
say the drop but we we have you know all that but you know we have a you know stuff like our goal
really right is incentivize um uh people to own their media and uh consume and connect with the
the creators that they love and like you know creators connect to them so we have a you know
we have a token that you uh that we launched that's going to be a consumer earn model and
then we just announced actually actually a layer two that were uh a layer two solution that we're
developing just for digital media so that we can take these types of projects right and and scale
them uh so that they could you know be you know we could launch something and have millions of
people purchase sort of simultaneously right so it's like part of that infrastructure
powered by by our stuff token as well but i mean like like you like we mentioned we're giving way
board right which is huge for you know one lucky person who who buys a copy of this and to get on
the white list so that we don't we don't really talk about that we're going to launch a collectible
version of the trailer and so we're going to make that available at stuff.io backslash altcoin
so you can go there you can redeem it without any you know we have like a whole promotional
process so you um you know if you have a wallet you can connect your wallet and get it otherwise
you know you create a wallet you can see how the whole process works you can see how media works
you can have a collectible version of that trailer which has some additional
uh footage in it uh just as an example for for your audience so they can see like how it uh how
it functions and you'll be added you'll be added to the white list of course right like that's the
process to get on the white list right and we're and we're announcing here i think i think you get
the answer do it sharon yeah that the movie's dropping on july 31st so it's coming man it's
coming i want to hear from you austin after you see it i do i want to know altcoin daily army is
going to show up i love it down below yeah let's go degens it is dude like i don't mean to like
overstate it but like it is it is i think it's kind of historic like i will tell you
you know we we did a press release a couple weeks ago announcing the project i don't think the
traditional entertainment press has wrapped its head around yeah but there were a few places that
picked it up and like you know you announce projects all the time right i've never had as
many colleagues and fellow creators reach out to me and be like dude this is genius oh my god
when can you we can we talk and you can fill me in on this i think it's really it's really exciting
it's really historic and i think for this community it is a time to kind of show like
this is viable this is a way for for artists filmmakers writers whatever you create
to interact with people directly and have it be a viable model for both ends it's beneficial for
the creator it's beneficial for the consumer as well so i feel like you know circle july 31st
and look back on it a couple years from now that's the day that's it's the promise of web 3 it's
the promise of web 3 it's literally how the movie opens like it talks about the promise of web 3 was
that you know creators it would be a creator economy right and i think it's just taking time
but that's percolating and like we're we're getting to the point now where that's actually
starting to happen that's is ultimately why we're here to usher in the decentralized future
which you know started right like like this is what i say to people like you can make a movie
with this and your computer right like i came up in the 90s and like the lurks days right like
which was which was the beginning of kind of an independent cinema right we used to go out
we'd get like a bunch of dentists to give you like five grand each you'd make your movie for
a hundred thousand bucks but you had to find like a steam back to cut it and you had to have
then develop a negative and develop your film you know the you know editing on your computer
shooting on video it democratized media right anyone can do it now right anyone can do it and
that's a great great thing it took the power out of the hands of the few who had the money
and the ability to do it and i feel like what blockchain is doing and what web 3 is doing
is now creating but you still back in those days you still had to find a distributor to distribute
your movie right you still there was still this power structure there that you had to you had to
work with i think this just democratizes media even more and it can live right alongside
traditional film festivals traditional media like it's just another tool you know for an artist to
have to expose their work to the world this way that way blockchain you take your pick well even
even like what you're doing austin right like fantastic content you're still beholden to these
centralized channels right if youtube just decided like hey we're going to cancel you guys tomorrow
like that's it like i mean that you lose a whole a whole channel whole like revenue source right
that's like ad base versus saying like hey you could drop episodes just alongside us like we're
another channel you could even drop them for free and people can now start having them now they've
got now they actually have it now that you know who they are right and have a direct connection
you start to you know opens up this whole new world of like connectivity that doesn't exist
in these centralized structures because their their goal is is control versus you know ours which is
just you know that open connection yeah i talked to a bunch of nft artists about that the algorithms
change and they lose their livelihood and they were like what the fuck so like the tech oligarchy
man like i'm a slave to the algorithm and i tell youtube please let me know the rules and hopefully
they do and we'll change because we're right now we are beholden to them and we love youtube
yeah of course we all we all love you but they're not that their business model is not to help you
figure that out yeah but there's there should be other options and there should be competition
and there should be the best thing for the user so i totally understand that the only way that
you get any agency is if you have some leverage totally we love we love our streamers we love our
broadcasters we love going to the movies this is another yeah this is a more empowering way
to consume the media you want to consume and the art you want to consume and as a creator
it's another uh arrow in your quiver and that's the beauty of it yeah i think i think streaming
is very much um like our goal isn't to replace streaming it's to augment it right so streaming
to me is like is our version of old you know fm radio right or you know public television right
we you know a lot it's like when you're still funded i don't think that's funded anymore
yeah anymore yeah but you know you would figure it out yeah you're using that to try to to
increase uh you know you you put trailers out to try to get people to go watch a movie to then
you know hopefully have them buy like a dvd of it and that's how you like generate the bulk
and then eventually goes to like a a you know a free type of environment for those people you know
so um yeah and josh while i have you here i know you just said this a couple of minutes ago but
what is this stuff token what is the use case it's using the infrastructure just say that again
for me while i have you here please yeah for sure so we uh the primary purpose of it is that it
powers like a creator based economy ecosystem so it moves around in a bunch of different ways the
primary way that moves from a consumer standpoint is earning it while you're either watching video
or listening to music or reading or listening to audiobooks or in your case like podcast type
content any type of content right we uh we purchase those tokens to distribute that way
based on what uh the sales volume is right so high sales volume we're purchasing tokens down
those get distributed to those people that are actually consuming and there's a bunch of other
ways that it integrates like we have a massive you know like a probably a too long uh version
of the of white paper that dives into deep deep detail of that but it's really to try to
you know unlock the ability where um uh from a enterprise freemantle you know original production
size scale can interact and you know they can um they can use a token to access uh data about
the audience to connect to them to remarket to them to uh spawn uh chat rooms where they are
then incentivized from uh you know participating in there through that token there's a lot of
different ways and we just use it as a basic um you know mechanism to where you can earn it and
then you could buy other content on the platform at a discount right so almost like um uh like
american airlines miles or loyalty points right like a very simple way that's easy for people
to understand that they're earning this token for doing something so again kind of going back
to the normie side where it's like you could pay with a credit card now you're earning your first
like cryptocurrency in the same way always more to talk about i think the main thing right now for
the audience is to watch the movie watch the trailer watch the movie and and get on that
white list and potentially get the the board ape um i want to have you guys back on when you guys
are up for that academy award or when it you know eight six months whenever that is that next step
but just final thoughts for the altcoin daily audience i hope you love this movie i just it's
made for you have a good time i'm excited i say make yeah make sure you go to stuff.io backslash
altcoin get your collectible trailer get on the white list and um yeah you can follow us on
twitter too it's stuff underscore io um yeah it's gonna be awesome yeah and sharon's right
it's made for the it's it's not just just for the ape community it's for the it's for the whole
you know crypto crypto curious and the crypto curious as well yeah that's that's that that would
be my final word is like the distribution model is unique the film is unique the subject matter is
unique it's kind of a cool unique experience that i i hope people will avail themselves on
gonna be awesome yeah cool thanks for having some man thanks for supporting yeah thank you awesome
