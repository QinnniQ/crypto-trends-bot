I think that Ethereum can generate a lot of transaction fees if it catches on and it becomes
kind of the base layer first for DeFi and maybe in the future for like large parts of
kind of the internet itself and like just become the platform on which many things are
built and like a lot of applications, a lot of businesses kind of host their application
logic and yeah, I'm like really bullish I think on this future.
I just don't think that you can really, I don't see by which mechanism you basically
say that like, oh, ETH should play a big role in this, like, you know, like people are not
all of a sudden going to prefer holding ETH over dollars or over stocks or over index
funds or over, you know, anything really, right, or like they will not also prefer trading
it against that.
Like there's, you know, you need to basically go to what people want to do and what problem
does ETH solve for people.
All right, here we are with Hasu, strategic advisor to LIDO and Flashbox.
Hasu, it's great to have you back on the Define Podcast.
Welcome.
Camila.
Thank you.
Thanks for having me back.
Yeah, always, always great to have you.
You know, you are very deep in one of Ethereum's biggest protocols, LIDO.
Can we just start by getting everyone on the same page about what LIDO is?
Yeah.
LIDO is the largest decentralized staking pool in Ethereum.
It's trusted by around 25% of all stakers.
And what makes LIDO special, you know, one, it's decentralized, so it's fully non-custodial.
When you give your stake to the protocol, it's distributed across a bunch of different
note operators, but you can always take the LDO back and you can hold it, you can always
take the ETH back and you can hold it in self-custody.
And the other big thing that makes LIDO different is its liquid, liquid staking.
So when you use stake, let's say on Coinbase or Binance or some other more centralized
provider, then you can, you know, also un-stake at any time, but you cannot use the stake
while it's sitting with this provider.
And how LIDO is different is you get a liquid staking token, in this case, it's called Stakedief.
You get that into your wallet and you can use that in one of many different DeFi integrations.
So for example, you can borrow against it on Aave or other lending protocols.
You can swap it.
You can stake it to an additional yield even.
And so, yeah, it's more capital efficient for that reason, and many people, you know,
engage in strategies like looping, which is borrow against your Stakedief to borrow more
ETH and then, you know, stake that to get more Stakedief, et cetera.
So it's very popular with all the liquid staking tokens, this strategy.
And so if you're like a smaller, you know, user, then you would mostly kind of engage
in these liquid strategies, but for bigger players, you know, like exchange traded products
for example, they have also kind of withdrawal rules, all redemption rules that they need
to serve from their regulators.
And so for them, the liquidity is also, you can think of it as a second kind of exit door
from the protocol, because when you stake normally, you know, it can, depending on the
size of the withdrawal queue, how congested it is, it can take up to weeks to get your
money out.
And when you have Stakedief, then you can not only unstake it the normal way, but you
can also sell it on the market, right?
So that gives you an additional way to exit your stake, which is a type of flexibility
that I think especially bigger users and institutions really value in LIDO as well.
Perfect.
Okay, now I'd love to dive into one of the latest developments in LIDO, which is a change
in governance.
And this is especially important given what you mentioned that 25% of stakers are using
LIDO.
It's crucial to have a very robust and decentralized and censorship-resistant governance systems.
What's the implications for the latest governance change?
Right.
So we recently released Dual Governance, which is a protocol upgrade that's been in development
for I think over three years at this point, from idea stage to final implementation.
So it's a really big deal for us.
And so why is, you know, basically in a nutshell, Dual Governance gives stakers the ability
to always veto any proposal that happens in the LIDO DAO, which is the DAO that's governing
the upgradability of the LIDO smart contract system.
And it guarantees that if enough stakers disagree with a proposal that they always can exit
in time.
And so why is that important?
So first, you know, governance, like Stakedief, the token, it has a certain security surface
that is basically controlled by governance.
And that is a risk for these stakers.
Right.
So we, in the beginning, we talked about how LIDO is more liquid than forms of direct staking.
But in the past, the benefit of direct staking was that because there's no smart contracts
involved, you don't need any upgradability.
So this one is actually like fully secure against any type of governance attack.
And so the way that other smart contracts handle this is, you know, A, they make the
smart contract immutable.
So if you look at a Uniswap, for example, Uniswap pool is immutable, right?
So there's never any risk that the Uniswap DAO or the Uniswap Labs kind of upgrades your
smart contract in a way that that would be bad for you.
The other way is you need to have it upgradable, but you just install what's called a time
lock.
So you just, you know, propose the passes, but then still, you know, there's a week or
two before it becomes executed where people can look at the changes and say, you know,
if those changes, I don't like them, then they can still leave.
So with LIDO, first of all, you need smart contracts to be upgradable.
And it's not for any like choice of hours, but it's because the Ethereum protocol itself
is changing and the staking implementation, the decentralized staking pool kind of needs
to be upgraded in order to even stay compatible with the changes that the Ethereum developers
make.
Or maybe at some point, that's no longer the case.
And I think we're looking forward to that day.
And the second problem we'd already hinted at is just the Ethereum exit queue has a variable
length, depending on how many people want to unstake.
That's because Ethereum doesn't want too many people to withdraw at the same time because
then they're worried that like basically the consensus could become unstable.
And so basically for LIDO, it would be very hard to make a time lock that's long enough
so that everybody can withdraw before every proposal.
And so the key insight behind dual governance is where you still want to have a time lock,
but what if you can make it dynamic?
So if the proposal is good, like it's harmless, and it's good for the stakers and the protocol,
then it can just pass right away.
But if anybody is concerned about the proposal, then it basically you have a longer time lock.
And if enough people say, you know, guys, we're really worried about this proposal,
like a lot of us are quite worried, then the governance just stops entirely.
And so the way that it's implemented is people can deposit their staked EVE or rep staked
EVE or their withdrawal NFTs from LIDO.
They put it in a smart contract that you can access.
You know, if you go to dg.lido.fi, dg meaning dual governance, and you can just, you know,
put your staked EVE there in an escrow contract.
And if 1% of all the stakers deposit in there, then the protocol enters the state that's
called veto signaling.
And then the protocol is, the governance is basically paused for between 5 to 45 days,
depending on how many people deposit.
And if 10% of stakers have deposited in this contract, meaning like either some very big
stakers disagree or like enough small stakers disagree, then the governance just becomes
frozen entirely.
And it stays frozen until everybody from this escrow has withdrawn their stake.
So like nobody disagrees anymore.
So what it means in principle is that the risk of any kind of smart contract, you know,
of any smart contract changes that are bad for the stakers happening, it's just like
it's massively reduced, right?
So neither the LIDO DAO can do anything.
For example, let's say, you know, increase the fees by 10x, right, that would be very
bad for stakers and would be clear instances where they just disagree.
But also a governance attack, maybe from the outside or something, somebody manages to
like sneak in a kind of malicious attack.
All of this can be now much more easily prevented.
And so when I was saying in the beginning that there used to be this trade off, like
either you do direct staking, but then you don't have liquidity or you get the liquidity.
But then, you know, you have to take a hit in the security because you're exposed to
the additional smart contractors.
I think dual governance basically solves this dilemma entirely.
So you can now have the liquidity of a liquid staking token, but with the security of direct
staking.
And so I think this is like a really big deal for stakers, especially those who care a lot
about liquidity and security.
Super interesting.
A couple of follow up questions.
One, how much participation do you usually get in governance?
So I'm thinking about stakers who might just be holding stake deeds, but aren't really
aware of what's happening in LIDO.
And maybe there is a proposal that would harm them, but they don't even know what to do
or like how to participate.
So I'm wondering how engaged invalidators are.
And the second follow up is whether there's any chance that, you know, like how immutable
are these mechanisms themselves, right?
Like maybe, maybe, yeah, like these time locks are in place, but at the time that you really
need them, maybe there can be some sort of attack to.
Yeah.
Okay.
So regarding your first question, so right now only the LDO token holders are voting
in governance and propose, like there's a 5% quorum.
So 5% of LDO holders need to agree to pass a vote.
And then the quorum, like it's always, you know, 5% of people voting.
Why?
Because I mean, if already 5% voted, proposal is already passing.
The incentive for more people to vote is basically, it doesn't exist, right?
So the thing to understand, like with LDO, only LDO holders can pass new proposals and
the StakeD folders can basically indefinitely like time lock the protocol.
So if they don't like the active proposals, then they can block it until, you know, they
had the time to leave, which is what matters basically for them.
But they can't make any proposals that would be bad for the DAO themselves.
So that is only, basically you have this like bicameral system now where like one party
can propose, but then the other party can basically veto.
And so I think that's very helpful.
So I think that, I think I, what you're getting at with your question is like, you know, are
these maybe numbers too high, like 1% and 10% are enough people even like paying attention
to what the, what those things are.
So there was a bunch of kind of, you know, nothing like this has been built before, right?
And so there was a bunch of kind of modeling involved from the LIDO side to arrive at the
right numbers that are like not too high, that basically you need to activate too many
people to do it, but also not too low.
So that like, it's very easy kind of to grief the protocol and like slow everything down.
And also it should be kind of robust to, you know, at one single party that's like, like,
you know, let's say like a big lending pool getting hacked and like StakeEve kind of taken
from there that it's also like robust against something like that.
So like in our mind, like it turned out that 1%, there's a lot, there's a bunch of individual
holders who hold more than 1% of StakeEve and like it's, so getting that kind of triggered
is like not that hard.
And then from there, you know, via social media, et cetera, I think it's relatively,
it's possible to kind of activate the necessary 10%.
And you have more time, right?
So every time like the number of people in the escrow contract goes up, also the time
lock extends up to 45 days.
So you have a lot of time to reach the 10%, like one and a half months is a long time
in crypto.
That's true.
And you're right that social media at least or X does serve as this sort of town hall
where, you know, at least you get a decent chunk of people are aware and participating.
Yeah, I mean, I hope, I think that, you know, if a dual governance actually activated in
Lido, I think even like the Defiant would write about it because I think it would be
very spicy.
Yeah.
That'd be a fun story.
So regarding the third part of your question, are these, you know, is this smart contract
actually immutable or can it be gamed?
So no, it is like it is immutable.
It's actually like part of the way that the Lido smart contract is upgraded, can only
be upgraded through this process that is, you know, like the Unita Aragon kind of Lido
contract kind of to, you know, you have Aragon voting whenever you want to upgrade the Lido
smart contract.
So the token orders need to agree and then the staked e-folders can disagree.
And so this is now part of the upgrade process and like this could be changed, but it requires
itself like an on-chain vote, right?
So like, you know, already like, you know, LDO orders would need to agree to change it
and staked e-folders would have to not disagree to change it.
And then it can be changed, but there's no other way that it can be changed.
Same as like nothing else in Lido can be changed outside of this process now.
Got it.
Is this already implemented?
Yeah, so the vote passed last week on Monday.
So it's now live.
So yeah, you can go to dg.lido.fi and can read like, this is the smart contract that
you can deposit in.
It's permissionless, like in its, you know, non-custodial.
And you can read the instructions there and you can see how many other, like what proposals
are currently live being voted on, how many other people have deposited in the contract
and how long the time log lasts.
Like this is your portal basically for engaging with this.
And yeah, I think if you, you know, if you hold staked EVE, I think it might be a good
idea to bookmark this and just like, so you know, you know where to go.
Cool.
Have there been cases in the past where you think this change would have been useful?
There have been like controversial upgrades in the past.
So no, I don't think so.
The thing is, I mean, this mostly, I mean, so this is secure basically against two things.
One is I think big tail risks.
So let's say there's like a really actually like malicious proposal happening maybe because
like somebody hacked enough LDO tokens or somebody, you know, found a way to like sneak
something like that in, in the, in the protocol.
And like this has not happened.
And if it had, then probably LiDAR wouldn't be like around anymore.
Okay.
So it's like for like really big edge cases.
Yeah.
And like, this is the one area where I think this is like extremely helpful, right?
It's like when a big edge case happens, you know, just a governance attack, let's say,
or hostile takeover, then it would be supremely useful, but it hasn't happened.
And if it had, then, you know, there's a high chance that LiDAR wouldn't be here anymore.
Got it.
Okay.
But the other thing is just, you know, let's say, you know, let's say there's almost like,
you know, like an activist investor who says, oh, but like, you know, why does Lido charge
only 10% fees to Stakers?
Shouldn't you charge like 50%?
You know, and so they, they make this proposal and it's not evil, right?
In the sense that, you know, they just think it's like better, you know, and, but then
the Stakers can still disagree with this and it wouldn't pass.
And so I think this is, you know, you know, it's even like, you know, kind of like not
technically malicious, but just like proposals that the Stakers don't like now are very hard
to pass.
So this, for example, I think doesn't mean that Lido can like never raise the fees, but
it needs, you need to have like a strong rationale that the Stakers actually agree with, right?
You know, if you say we're going to raise, you know, fees by 2% because we want to invest
in the way that makes this protocol better for you, makes it more liquid, more integrations,
whatever then, you know, like it needs to grow the pie.
And that's important.
Everything can still pass if the Stakers think it's good.
But if the Stakers think it's a bad idea for them, then now it's just very, very difficult
to pass anything.
Super interesting.
I wanted to get back to the point about, you know, how much of Stake ETH is in Lido with
25% of staking concentrated in the protocol.
Are there systemic risks to Ethereum of having so much of ETH in one, in one protocol?
Yeah, so, I mean, I think it's a nuanced question.
I think there used to be like a big debate about this a couple years ago.
And so, I mean, in general, when like a centralized actor controls a lot of stake, I think the
risk is there's a non-zero risk, you know, not, it can still be decentralized in the
sense of like non-custodial for the user.
So it's not like they can steal all this.
But if they can control the way that blocks are proposed, for example, or like attestations
are made and they cross certain thresholds in the protocol, then there are things that
they can do to like hurt the consensus, you know, make the chain not finalize or something
like that.
Again, in practice, the incentives to do any such attack are basically non-existent because
the social consensus of the blockchain can always kind of override that, you know, you
will still get slashed and you can also be socially slashed because it's very attributable
basically to like a single party.
So I've always thought this is like, it's mainly like an optical concern for some people.
It's not a real concern.
Like if you wanted to hurt Ethereum, there would be much better ways to kind of do such
an attack rather than kind of misappropriating like funds trusted to you by your staking
customers when you have a business that's like working very well, it just doesn't make
any sense.
So that said, I think if you have actually decentralized stake and protocol, then of
course, those risks even are like much smaller yet, right?
Because in LIDL, you give your ETH to a protocol and it automatically distributes it to hundreds
of different node operators and those node operators all decide on their own what blocks
they want to produce and they don't, you know, there's like, I think the biggest node operator
has like 1% of stake in LIDL.
And so it's, you know, there's no coordination between them and there's no control exerted
by the LIDL protocol over those node operators.
You know, there are some rules that they have to follow.
So they have to pay all the rewards basically to a LIDL address because that's how we basically
make sure that they don't funnel away some rewards away from the stakers they belong
to, right?
But apart from that, there's no pressure exerted on them.
So I think in general, this issue has become like much, I think, less important in the
community than it was a couple of years ago.
I think there was a big kind of scare, I think, two, three years ago when LIDL was still like
hadn't been around as long and it was at a similar market share and people were like,
yeah, okay, this is clearly going to grow to like 50% and then 100% because liquid staking
has a lot of network effect and all the staking configurations are like the same.
So you would always kind of favor like, you know, everybody will like hold the same token
and because it's more liquid, everybody will kind of switch to that.
And I think in reality, like that just hasn't happened.
So I think if anything, then it turns out that there are more different ways that people
want to stake.
Like some people actually prefer direct staking, some prefer exchange staking, some prefer
liquid staking, some prefer restaking, some prefer like more customized kind of setups.
Like we can get into that when we talk about LIDL v3 because LIDL v3 is basically our
response to this change in the market.
But yeah, like it turns out that I think the marginal value of liquidity tapers off much
faster than people expected and like LIDL is kind of at a, you know, roughly similar
market share than it was like, you know, three years ago or two, three years ago.
And so I think this risk that any one provider is like going to grow to like 100% market
share.
I think that's not really happening.
And then, I mean, I think in a lot of ways also LIDL makes it even better, especially
if you compare it to a realistic baseline.
So I think a lot of people a couple of years ago were still like, yeah, but, you know,
it looks like we would rather have everybody just solo staking, you know, or like if there
were like 100, like 1% providers or like even 10, 10% providers, but then it turns out,
you know, there was like never realistic, right?
Like the stake will always kind of centralize somewhere because there's economies of scale
and there's brand and people want to go like with the brand that they trust and that's
convenient for you and all those things.
I think it's just a matter of like which providers are kind of, you know, getting like 20, 30,
40% market share.
You can't really avoid it.
And with LIDL or liquid staking in particular, I think, you know, it really lowers the barriers
to entry in staking.
Like it's actually, we make it easier to be kind of a solo staker because you can actually
like by engaging kind of in LIDL as a solo staker, you can stake some of your own money
and then you can also get money from LIDL to stake.
And so we're giving, effectively giving you leverage on what you're already doing and
you're controlling like everything yourself.
And if you're a user slash staker, then you can just, you know, give the money to a protocol.
It's fully non-custodial and decentralized, you don't have to worry about it.
Every day just the balance in your wallet will go up and you're contributing to the decentralization
of Ethereum.
And yeah, the node operator set, if you look like at the node operators inside LIDL, it's
much more distributed geographically.
There's a higher client diversity, there's kind of fewer nodes in the big data centers
and more self-hosting and like all of the things that we care about than actually like
outside of LIDL.
Why?
Well, because we actually care about this, right?
So we want to make the Ethereum validator set as decentralized as possible.
And so we can make some rules inside LIDL and then, you know, this is how we distribute
the stake and it's just very like good for Ethereum.
I think that, yeah, there are, I don't want to say there are no risks, but I think especially
if it's a decentralized staking pool, then those risks are like not very big, especially
compared to the benefits that you're getting from this as well.

What about the how open the system is to actually becoming a node operator?
Can anyone do this?
Like what are, what are the requirements?
Yeah.
So there's two types of node operator right now in LIDL.
We have one module that's called the curated set.
And so this is generally for professional node operators.
They can apply and then like twice per year they can be added to the set if they've basically
follow certain, like if they meet certain criteria in terms of quality.
The other way is you can actually be a home staker and this is completely permissionless.
And so yeah, actually you could like with the home staking setup, like, you know, go
to CSM, I think it's csm.lido.fi and yeah, you can basically like register there, your
validator.
And if you like, again, like select the right kind of reward address, you will get some
stake from LIDL and you will have some stake of your own that's used as collateral basically
to kind of make sure you're not getting slashed or something.
Yeah.
And then you can actually participate in this and CSM launched a couple of months ago only
and already like maxed out its cap twice.
So it's now at 2% of LIDL share and we're going to keep increasing it because it's like
a very capital efficient way of doing it.
Like it's permissionless, which we generally much prefer.
And it's also very capital efficient because like people bring like some of their own stake
to LIDL.
You know, LIDL gives them some stake, but they bring their own stake and they operate
the notes at home.
And yes, I think just like overall really good.
Is that related to the distributed validator technology that you mentioned or how does
that work?
Yeah.
So distributed validator technology for our listeners.
I mean, it's basically a way of like, you know, if you know how like a multi-sig smart
contract works, you know, multiple people are controlling the same key.
This is equivalent of multiple parties being able to control the same validator.
And so they can propose blocks together and like make attestation decisions together.
And this is generally good, I mean, for the security because it's, you know, much harder
to let's say, you know, behave for one party, but this also improves like the operational
efficiency because it's, you know, even if like, let's say you're in a like DVT set up
with four other people and like one or two of them maybe go offline and miss their slot.
As long as the other three kind of still decide to sign like the block, then you will still
build the block.
Right.
And so it's really like a way of kind of driving operational efficiency.
So DVT, we use it in LIDL in its own module.
So we have a DVT module and it's basically, this was a way of basically testing this in
LIDL in a kind of more controlled way.
And so this was like all specific kind of, you know, only in order for us to use DVT
and kind of wanted to pioneer this for Ethereum.
But increasingly DVT is actually just, you know, used in all of the modules.
We allow, you know, in the curated set or the CSM module, we allow people to use DVT
and it kind of, you know, makes their setups more robust and improves.
It just improves at the end of the day, like the bottom line of LIDL, right.
And like what money that we can make for the stakers.
And it's good for Ethereum because like there's fewer, like let's say missed slots.
It's very hard to get slashed, whether by intention or by accident.
So it's just like, it's very useful.
I think the one, the kind of challenge or like the difficulty is, so you do, you have
almost like two tiers of DVT, right?
So like, let's say you have maybe five different machines and you just like connect those together
with DVT, but it's all your own kind of setup on your own premise, right?
Or in your, on your rented server in a data center.
Then this is like, you know, could almost like call this like tier one DVT and it's
still useful.
Like it's still helping with operational efficiency, but it doesn't help with this, like you specifically
kind of wanting to do something that would be bad, right?
And so there's this other kind of even more useful and expansive tier of DVT where it's
actually you and four other people who you don't even know kind of being in a set together,
right?
So doing this and like coordinating this across many different node operators, maybe not even
know each other, coordinating this, getting them signed up.
I think this is like a challenge that Lido is also working on.
And that's if you want to get really like the full, full value of DVT, then you need
a lot of infrastructure for this, for this kind of, you know, coordinating at first,
like in a more kind of, you know, centrally managed way, but then giving people kind of
the tools to do it all on their own and like discovering kind of their peers and setting
this up and testing it.
And so, yeah, that's something that we want to do to eventually, I think, scale this everywhere.
Like I think this can just be, you know, if it works, it's just like part of the baseline
kind of setup that everybody will use.
Cool.
So, you know, like, yeah, we've talked a lot about how Lido is working to reduce the risk
that it may pose to Ethereum and validators with this new governance system, with DVT,
but you know, there's, there's still this, there's kind of a growing discussion about
whether there just should be a maximum cap of state ETH.
I had Justin Drake on the podcast a few months ago and he discussed this saying that he doesn't
think there should be more than 50% of ETH state at all.
And so he wants to decrease the amount of issuance that goes to validators to, to kind
of disincentivized staking when that, when ETH reaches 50% of, when more than 50% of ETH
is staked.
So, yeah, when he mentioned this, the first thought was like, oh, I wonder what Lido thinks
of this.
So, yeah, I wanted to get your reactions to this proposal.
Yeah, there have been actually a bunch of different, I mean, there have been a lot of
proposals kind of in this direction and I think it's kind of people trying to figure
out a little bit what they want.
So, I mean, in my view, I think in Ethereum, folks on the research side are generally a
little bit worried about what happens if like too much ETH is staked and the number one
argument they give is, I mean, the number one argument I would say they give is like
other tokens will then like replace ETH as collateral and like ETH should have the special
status in the protocol.
This argument in particular has never kind of really resonated with me because ETH is
being replaced as the main collateral anyway.
First of all, I think stablecoins are actually about to flip ETH in market cap, including
like in DeFi as well, like as collateral, if you look in like lending markets.
And this will just be like, there's only one direction like this can go, right?
Like, I mean, we all, I think, expect that ETH will play a very small role kind of in
the future of DeFi because people want to get leverage on all kinds of assets, right?
I mean, if you just look in TradFi, then that's what you see.
Second, like, you know, if ETH is in a smart contract, it can be upgraded or ETH is in
a roll-up bridge or ETH is in a centralized exchange wallet.
I mean, these are all different ways of like encumbering the ETH.
And it's like in this idea that there's this all of this like pristine ETH and it has
this great security property.
I think it's just, you know, is A not true today and B is not, you know, if you play
it out into the future is anyway, like not really, doesn't matter that much.
And then I think if you look actually like in other chains, ETH is like the total
anomaly in terms of like, that there's only, I think we have around 30% staked right
now. Like, I think it's a total anomaly how little is staked in Ethereum.
And for example, Solana, which is a much younger network, has 70% staked and it's
fine. What is kind of seen as bad by some Ethereum people is actually a design goal
for other people.
Like they just want staking kind of to be as democratized as possible.
They are saying that if we kind of, you know, if we kind of, like they want this,
like the staking, the people who stake and the people who actually own the currency,
they want the set to be like, you know, as overlapping as possible to kind of align
the incentives and yeah, like it's, they also like think it's generally good for
DeFi if kind of the, you know, there's a way to get yield on their native token.
So there's like a bunch of reasons why it's, this is actually like a design goal
for other chains and it's working great for them.
But in Ethereum, we're like more worried about what happens to ETH.
I think the argument was that they see as 50% being enough to, for like security
purposes. And so that they see it as inefficient if more than 50% is staked.
And like, like, yeah, as you said, they would rather that ETH be used across DeFi
or for payments or whatever, like in other ways and not be kind of locked up, you
know, staked away.
Yeah, I mean, like, but you can still use it for all of these things, even if it
stakes, right? That's kind of the, I mean, first of all, you don't need like that
much ETH to do these things because people want to use stablecoins or other
tokens for them anyway. And it's kind of an illusion that like, well, if you just
allow people to use ETH, they will use ETH for these things. Like, you know, no,
like nobody wants to do all this stuff against ETH. Like, ETH is being replaced
everywhere. Like, you know, it's no longer really used, you know, as a dominant
trading pair indeed. Because why would you, why would I prefer to like, make a
liquidity pool against ETH? Like, because it's much more risk, right? Like, if I
can do it against USD instead. And so yeah, I just think this argument is kind
of not that great. The other big one, I think this is more like the argument of
kind of, so if you're on the other side and you say, I'm really like against
kind of capping on the staking rate, then the main argument from that side is
mostly, so the lower you cap the staking rate, the more centralized your node
operator set will become. And if you look at a kind of most extreme example of
this, so let's say only 5% of ETH are allowed to be staked. And you do this by
after like 5%, just the rewards go just like very low or even negative, right?
Then what happens is the people who can make the most money from staking will
replace everybody else, right? So like who can make the most money from staking?
It will be people who basically, you know, host it all in one data center and to
engage in like the most risky behavior with their ETH. So maybe it's like
restaked and it's like restaked multiple times and it's like leveraged and it's
like using every sidecar and like points farming and whatnot, right? So you're
trying to really like, you have to, the protocol forces you to kind of juice
like the absolute maximum from your ETH, right? And so it's just like the best
thing for the protocol. I don't think so, right? So sensor resistance and
decentralization are really like really core properties that make ETH different
from other chains. And I think it needs to really like protect these properties.
And you generally get a more, like much more diverse node operator set and like
less of this kind of price pressure if you just allow like a bigger staking
market. Because then people will have more diverse preferences for what they
want to do. All of those like super kind of like yield seeking people still
exist, right? And you still have centralized setups, but you also have
more room for like more decentralized systems to also coexist and, and things
that have like a lower margin or that like don't engage in all the riskiest
stuff. So that's kind of the trade off there. So that said, I think I don't hate
the idea of like capping it at 50%. I think at 50%, probably you get a bunch of
the benefits that I talked about without necessarily incurring those, those
downsides per se. I mean, if you look right now, like we're at 30%, we have
actually been at 30% roughly for I think the last nine months. So it's not like,
you know, if staking rate is exploding or anything. So I think that what I
probably like, you know, what I'm generally in favor of just like letting
the staking rate like run anywhere. Like I don't think it's bad to have a high
staking rate because I know all these other networks, they have a high staking
rate and it's like totally fine. They actually get a lot of value from it. And
so, but because of how far away we are from 50% and I don't really expect us to
really run against this barrier anytime soon, I think it's probably fine. So I
don't hate the proposal, but I think I'm more leaning towards the camp that
actually high staking rate is totally fine.
Yeah, I don't know, I think I see merits to both, but I'm interested to dive into
what you think the role of ETH is because yeah, you mentioned how you
believe that ETH doesn't need to have a huge role in DeFi. And I think that's a
pretty, it could be seen as a bit of a controversial take. So we'd love to kind
of get more of your thoughts on that.
Yes, I mean, so I think that ETH is always going to play a role in DeFi, but
it's just going to be kind of eclipsed by all of these other assets coming into
DeFi as well, that are much bigger in the real world. And so I don't think you
should see it as kind of me saying that I'm bearish on ETH or anything, like I
know I'm really bullish on DeFi. And so that's more the reason. And like ETH
I'm becoming the home of DeFi. And so I think the role of Ethereum is the primary
role will honestly be just like ownership share in the network, like an
access, basically access to, I mean, so on the one end, it's like used in staking
to secure the network. And then the other hand, it's just giving you like access to
kind of the cash flows from buybacks that happens through E1559, which is, you
know, fees being paid on Ethereum, the protocol burns in order to pay to e-folders.
And so, you know, even if that's like its primary role, that would be totally fine.
And I think that Ethereum can generate a lot of transaction fees if it catches on
and it becomes kind of the base layer first for DeFi and maybe in the future for
like large parts of kind of the internet itself and like just become the platform
which many things are built and like a lot of applications, a lot of businesses
kind of host their application logic. And yeah, I'm like really bullish, I think
on this future. I just don't think that you can really, I don't see by which
mechanism you basically say that like, oh, you should play a big role in this.
Like, you know, like people are not all of a sudden going to prefer holding ETH
over dollars or over stocks or over index funds or over, you know, anything
really, right? Or like they will not also prefer trading it against that.
Like there's, you know, you need to basically go to what people want to do
and what problem does ETH solve for people.
So it is, it is basically more immutable, right?
It's, it's, it's more censorship resistant than holding other stuff on chain.
And so there is a need for that, right?
So I'm not going to minimize that.
So there are people who basically want to hold something that cannot be kind of
confiscated by, by someone else.
And ETH plays that role the same way that Bitcoin plays it.
I think Bitcoin probably plays it better, right?
So maybe ETH can, can rival that in the future.
But right now, if I just want to hold, you know, if I want a Swiss bank in my
pocket, Swiss bank account in my pocket, I want to have money that nobody else
can take, probably I'm still, I mean, I, I'm actually in the camp that I want to
hold both Bitcoin and ETH because Ethereum, like Bitcoin is like probably as a
network is more, even more decentralized and robust and like unlikely to change.
But in Ethereum, I really like the way that I can program the way that like
I custody my funds.
So that's really a great feature of Ethereum.
The fact that I can have like, I can have a custody setup that doesn't actually
have a private key, that only, you know, that, that I don't, I need to like, I
don't have a physical, don't need to have a physical copy.
I can have like elaborate kind of social recovery setups and, and I can
program my own spending limits.
And like, we don't have that in Bitcoin, right?
And I think we may get it if like something like OPC-TV eventually makes it
in the protocol, which I think it will, but you know, right now this stuff is
like not really possible to do on Bitcoin and on Ethereum, it's super democratized.
So I think this is actually like a really underrated aspect of, of Ethereum, but
yeah, like the, this use case is just, I mean, even if you look at like how many
people hold gold for similar reasons, like in the real world, gold is absolutely
tiny, like compared to, you know, like just like the dollar or, you know, stocks
or even, yeah, too many other asset classes.
And that's why I think basically that like, you know, Ethereum will not eclipse,
you know, for the very similar reason, like Ethereum has a smaller role to play as well.
So to clarify, you view Ethereum's role primarily as a place for programmable
money, right, for, for DeFi.
And so like, it is attractive for the fees, for the access to, to the, the
revenue generated, the fees generated on the network because of people are
transacting and building there.
Yeah, so I mean, Ethereum, the blockchain and like the ecosystem, I think is, it
has a good chance at becoming, I mean, what we call the world computer, world
settlement layer, whatever you want to call it.
And I think that DeFi is the first, I mean, it's the first use case in that,
but it won't be the last.
Like DeFi is just such good kind of product market fit for Ethereum and
crypto in general, because there's, you know, a lot of value transferred and it
really benefits from permissionless innovation because it's so highly
regulated and so fragmented and such.
Like basically it's so common that in this way that like people are abused
through kind of confiscations or censorship or inflation and like for all
those reasons, I think like DeFi really hits kind of a mark and this would be
like, this is already like the breakthrough use case for, for crypto in
many ways with like stable coins in particular, but it doesn't mean that
I think it's going to end there, right?
I think the same, the same way that everything moved, you know, everything's
becoming like software and it started like moving to the cloud.
I mean, I could see a similar trend happen in the future.
With crypto, it's just technology just becomes part of like every stack, you
know, every, just the way that like important software is written where, you
know, if you want people to trust it, you know, it's going to be on Ethereum or
like a similarly kind of established blockchain.
And I think you can, you can attract a ton of like, you know, if you get these
use cases would be extremely valuable for Ethereum and even if everybody pays
like a small fee, even if it's just a cent, if there's millions of transactions
like per second, which is totally feasible or even like sub-cent, right?
Then you're still going to, you can still, still build one of the
basically most valuable businesses in the world or in the history even.
And so, yeah, I think that's the future that I, that I would like to see for ETH.
What if sending crypto felt more human?
Pulse just launched Red Packets, a new way to gift tokens with meaning.
It's gasless, gamified, and claimable inside group chats only.
Think AirDrops meet social cues on-chain.
Backed by smart wallet tech and live across major L2s, Red Packets turn
communities into micro economies of gratitude and growth.
No seed phrases, no friction, just connection with value.
Check it out at Pulse.social.
Um, okay.
I know that we're running up against time and I do want to get, get, to
talk about Lido v3 and also, you know, you're, you're like growing integrations
with DeFi.
Yes.
So, so can, yeah, can we, can we get into that?
Yeah, let's, um, let's talk about Lido v3.
Okay.
So I already mentioned in the beginning, I think a couple of years ago, people
were like, there's only one way to stake and liquidity is just the most important
thing and like everything else doesn't matter.
Turns out that's not the case.
So there's many more ways that people want to stake.
And so the staking market is actually more fragmented today than it ever was.
And so Lido, if you go kind of back, or even if you look like right now, before
Lido v3, Lido is effectively, can think of it as like, it's a way to get
liquidity on like a validator or like a staking setup, but it has only one
collateral type, which is what we call Lido core.
So it's this like central place, you know, where you give your money and it's
staked across many different load operators that all follow like relatively
standardized rules after Lido v3, we are creating a separation between this
liquidity layer and the staking infrastructure.
So you could say Lido becomes a platform.
And so what this means in practice, so with Lido v3, anybody can create what
we call staking vaults.
And these staking vaults can basically be any, like these are still not like
a validator kind of at the core, but you can use any setup that you want.
So you can pick your own node operator.
You can run any Ethereum sidecar that you want.
You can charge any fee that you want.
You can use it in restaking.
You can do, you can use like only certain relays in MathBoost or you don't
use MathBoost or whatever you want.
And you can still, you can do all of this and you can still get
liquidity on that staking setup.
And so that's, that's a really big kind of innovation because before everybody had
to use the exact same setup in Lido to get the liquidity, and now you can use
your own setup and you can control everything about it.
And so it kind of even further closes this gap between direct staking and liquid
staking, and there's a lot of use cases that would benefit from this.
So, you know, institutions like having kind of know your business rules.
So they need to decide, like they need to select and like have legal contracts
with very specific node operators and they either need to be all in the U.S.
or like they cannot be in the U.S.
So for example, we have like seen, seen both of those maybe opinionated about
the use of any infrastructure.
They, you know, they want to, they maybe want to get liquidity and they have an
agreement with an operator, you know, Lido charges 10%, so maybe they only
want to charge like 2%, right?
So now you can do that as well.
And yeah, so there's many things that you can do and you can like only use the
part of Lido that you really care about, which is basically, you know, the
liquidity and the integrations and the security.
So yeah, that's what the, that's what the main idea is behind V3.
And yeah, it's going to go live in, I mean, it's, it's rolling out in phases
and like, it's going to go live in a couple of months.
Interesting.
Okay.
So it's a more customizable version of staking, giving validators more control.
And like the first thought, the first thing that came to mind when, when you
said kind of the, the, um, geo-fencing or like picking where the validators are
is with, with ETFs, um, and, and just like kind of like securities and regulatory
concerns, do you, do you see this as, as a way to give more kind of traditional
finance access to staking?
For example, maybe BlackRock wants to issue a, uh, a state ETF, but it
hasn't been approved in the U S but maybe they can make that product available
for just for kind of validators that are outside of the U S or using investors.
And, and just like I said, that's, that doesn't touch the U S is that a
potential use case as well?
Yeah.
So I can't talk about BlackRock in particular, but in general, what we're
seeing kind of from institutional customers that we speak to is that, I
mean, they really value security, which is also why dual governance, for example,
is like a big deal, but they also really value customization.
They may have specific demands put on them about like what noto providers,
for example, they can use.
And so this helps them basically gain more control so they can, they can do
this, but then also like liquidity really matters a lot in the institutional
market because they have to meet the redemptions as we kind of, this is
where we started the conversation, right?
And so if you're an ETF provider or an ETP provider, you need to meet
redemptions within 48 hours, for example, then you're competing with the other
providers on, on like how, on the APR that you provide or the fees that you
have to charge to, to your users.
And the main lever that you have actually is like how much of your if you can
stake and so, you know, between like, you know, one provider using direct
staking and maybe can like stake 25% of their EIF and somebody else using liquid
staking, they can say maybe stake 75%.
So that's a really big deal in the bottom line and in the competitive position
that you can have in this market.
And so, yeah, I think that, you know, it's a matter, it's only, I think, a matter of
time, like I think liquid staking is, is really good for institutions.
And so, yeah, I think that we basically makes us even more, or like removes like
even more roadblocks that, that kind of may, may have existed in the past.
So right now, what do you think the, the makeup is between your, or, or
like, or Lytos and stakers?
Like, is it mostly retail stakers?
And do you see that breakup moving more to institutions?
Yeah.
So we did actually a study on this, an internal one, a couple of months ago, and
we only separated into like institutional customers and non-institutional and
turned out that 25% of staked EIF is already used by institutions.
So like even in its kind of, you know, before dual governance and before vaults,
like, you know, staked EIF is still the most secure way that like you can do
staking while also getting liquidity on this and, you know, that, you know, just
the ability to kind of use the staked EIF as collateral somewhere and sell it
really quickly, like faster than you can, then you can unstake it.
I think our two properties that are really valuable, like a couple of days
ago, we saw Lytos being added as collateral in Maple Finance as well.
So this is like a good example of this because what it does is basically it
was added as collateral.
So like institutional clients can deposit staked EIF and they can borrow stable
coins against it so they can get leverage, right?
So yeah, in general, just like staking is much more attractive when you can have
a liquidity and then you can use it as collateral.
And so, yeah, we try to, you know, staked EIF is listed on most major
exchanges and so, you know, you can use it on Binance or Bybit or like other
places, right, and you can kind of use it to collateralize like the trading that
you do and so that's, you know, the more venues that staked EIF is added in, I
think the more useful it is for our customers.
So, okay, so that was already 25% of institutional stakers.
Now with V3 and staked vaults, you probably see that percentage growing.
Yeah, I mean, I would think so.
I think in general, like the markup of like institutional customers in
DeFi versus, you know, non-institutional, I think is changing in that way, right?
So I think that that will affect Lytos as well, but yeah, it will affect, I
think, also everybody else.
Awesome.
Okay, and now to wrap up and related to this, how do you see Lytos to
continue integrating into DeFi?
Like are there other protocols that you're working with or how would you
want it to see Lytos continue to grow within Ethereum?
Yeah, so I think that Lytos is already integrated pretty much everywhere.
I mean, staked EIF I think is the relatively clear leader in terms of
integrations, it's been around five years, I think, by this point.
You know, has existed already like I think one and a half years before
even the merge happened.
And so, you know, what you can always do is like give people more
things to do with a staked EIF.
I think that's a big priority.
So I think in the past, Lytos hasn't always been kind of open to, I think
people who just want to maximize the yield that they can get on staking, like
it was more opinionated in the sense of, you know, here's what we think is like
a good kind of standard, this is the best like standard I've set up that you
can get is kind of similar to like, you know, people holding like the S&P
500 or something like that, right?
But then there are people who want to, you know, hold like the S&P 500
leveraged or they want to hold like a more risky set of assets or something,
right?
And I think serving those folks' preferences as well is something that we
are like trying to do now more than ever.
And so V3 is a kind of reflection of that.
It's basically giving other people the ability to make use like staked EIF in
ways that are, you know, much more diverse for users, right?
So for example, if you look in like Morpho compared to Aave, Morpho uses
this idea of a curator and it's actually very similar with vaults.
It's the idea that like a staking vault also has a type of curator.
And so it's kind of more of a like, it's not necessarily like end users using
V3, but it's businesses building on top that can make much more diverse products.
And we're trying to make that as easy as possible.
And yeah, so I think we really want to make it easy kind of to get like the
absolute maximum yield that you can if you're into that.
And yeah, I think you can expect more on that in kind of the next few months.
That'll be fascinating to see as kind of LIDO becomes a place for not just
stakers, but also businesses and, you know, projects to build on top of LIDO
to make their own, you know, staking protocols, like staking projects and dApps
will be a really interesting evolution, which we will of course be covering at
the Defiant.
So Hasso, thank you so much for joining me.
A pleasure as always chatting a really fascinating talk.
Oh, it's great to talk to you, Camilla.
Thank you.
