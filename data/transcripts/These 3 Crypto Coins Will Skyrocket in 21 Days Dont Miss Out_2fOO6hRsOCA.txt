The narrative of ether is really powerful. And now we have not, not just, you know, one,
we have two major ETH treasury companies and another one coming and they're raising capital
every day and buying ether. And so there's not a lot of supply of ETH. And so I think ETH probably
has a chance to outperform Bitcoin in the next three to six months. If you hold crypto, get ready
just in the global M2 money supply hit another all time high. The reason why this is important
every single time the M2 money supply has gone up, historically Bitcoin's price follows. I'm
actually surprised. It seems like so many people are under invested, missing out on what's about
to happen. I don't think a lot of people, even people who already hold crypto, realize the shift
that's happening in markets right now. People, Wall Street, nation states, institutions, entities
with real money are buying in big. If you hold Bitcoin, if you hold Ethereum, if you hold Solana,
if you hold quality altcoins, the next three to six months will be your best chance to become
a millionaire. Let me show you. Smash the like button, make sure you watch the entire video today
or risk missing out. You don't want to miss out on another major crypto bull run. So Bitcoin's price
is close to breaking out right now. The next leg up, well, billionaire Wall Street investor,
Mike Novogratz, says Bitcoin's next move will be to 150,000. The main driver right now is this
plethora of balance sheet companies, right? Micro strategy lookalikes that are showing up, not just
in Bitcoin, but in crypto across the board. ETFs were a pretty darn good way to get exposure.
There are some cryptos where staking and DeFi and on-chain yield will enhance that total performance
over time. And so it's the rage. And that's brought in at least $20 billion of new money
just going. That's reunited retail fervor. What could Bitcoin go to? What do you think's
reasonable? What's the upside and downside case at this moment? Yeah, you listen,
I think we're in price discovery and a lot of these things. And so does 130, 150. 150 seems
to me a decent target just when I kind of draw funny lines on my charts. It feels like we're
destined to go higher as long as this narrative continues. If Trump changes his mind and says,
hey, we've done such good work. The economy doesn't need lower rates. That would change
my thesis. But until that happens, I think we're headed towards 150. Like understand the different
vectors of demand that are coming into crypto nowadays. There's nation state treasuries,
there's institutional investment, there's corporate treasuries, there's emerging market safe haven,
there's financial services. In five years, the bear case for Bitcoin is half a million dollars.
The base case, what we expect is 1.2 million. The bull case is 2.4 million. And that's not
coming from me. That's coming from ARK Invest. And we're seeing ARK Invest reallocate more into
altcoins, buying 4.4 million shares of a Peter Thiel backed Ethereum treasury firm. Solana looking
bullish as well as three hours ago, they unveiled their 2027 roadmap to lead internet capital
markets. They're targeting where the big money is. This is bullish for Solana. So crypto natives like
us or Wall Street or nation states or whatever demand vector that you can think of, everybody
seems actually under allocated to Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. Listen to Kathy Woods talk about the
bull outlook for these three tokens. It's volatile, no question. And that's the first thing people have
to know about it. But it is becoming less volatile as more and more investors hold it. So you think
Bitcoin will potentially multiply in value by 15 times in the next five years?
Wow, that'd be pretty crazy. It's a very big idea, because it is a new asset class.
It does represent a global monetary system, unlike any other digital asset out there.
It is backed by the largest computer network in the world. The layer one, which is the base layer,
has not been hacked. Think about that. Since 2009, when it was released, not been hacked.
How many systems can say that? And it is a technology. It is native to the internet. And again,
digital assets or any Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, all of them exist because they're vying to be
the native currencies to the internet and to enable smart contracts and really transform
the financial services industry. Another question popped up, which is about Ethereum
and these other cryptocurrencies. Do you invest in any of these others?
Yes, we have them in some of our funds, both of them. They're key to the financial services
revolution. So to get people to understand and feel comfortable with that, we don't call it the
crypto revolution. It's the digital assets revolution. And it's simply the Finternet,
the financial internet. So we do, we do. And you believe, are you more bullish on
the price potential of Bitcoin than Ethereum? Yes, we think Bitcoin is the biggest idea.
It serves the three revolutions. Global monetary system, they do not. New asset class,
they are part of a new asset class, but Bitcoin is going to be the biggest. And new technology,
it's the most secure blockchain technology out there.
What about all these other Solana and all these other?
So Ether and Solana, so the big three are the big three. And we think they'll all be successful,
all three of them. Bitcoin the most. We're very interested in stable coins, but that's just like
cash. And there are millions of crypto assets out there. We think most of them die.
And it seems like it is Ethereum that's about to make that next big move.
ETH ETF inflows have been skyrocketing over the past five trading days. Wall Street is
buying Ethereum. Wall Street and institutions and financial service companies are using Ethereum.
The value of tokenized RWAs on Ethereum reached 8 billion. So that makes real world assets and
stable coins on the Ethereum network, both at all time highs. There's been so much Ethereum ETF
buying that BlackRock's Ethereum ETF just hit a major milestone, the third fastest in its history,
in all ETF history, to hit 10 billion in assets. A big move is coming for Ethereum.
Wall Street billionaire Mike Novogradz says the narrative of Ethereum is really powerful.
There's not a lot of supply of ETH, and I think Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin in the next six
months. What do you make of some of the other coins? So Ether, we just had somebody on this
week putting together the equivalent of an Ether micro strategy of sorts in terms of a leveraged
bet that other people are going to be able to buy into. Also, everything's getting tokenized.
We've talked about stable coins. Right now, if you could buy Ether or Bitcoin, which do you buy?
I own both. Listen, Ether's caught up a lot. It feels like if Ether takes out 4,000,
it goes into price discovery. And so we feel kind of destined to at least knock on the 4,000 ceiling
a few times. The narrative of Ether is really powerful, and the market was really short.
And now we have not just one, we have two major ETH treasury companies and another one coming.
And they're raising capital every day and buying Ether. And so there's not a lot of supply of ETH.
And so I think ETH probably has a chance to outperform Bitcoin in the next three to six
months. Like, do you see what's going on? Do you get the implications of this yet? Wall Street
institutions, big money is under allocated to quality crypto, particularly seeing the positive
pro crypto regulations that have been approved in the United States. Everybody's realizing I'm
under allocated to the quality crypto market. Because think about what's about to happen to
crypto over the next six months, year, two years. Investing expert Rick Edelman says we're going to
see trillions of dollars flowing into crypto over the next four years. It's going to put Bitcoin at
half a million dollars by the end of the decade. And that's not even his bull case. Listen.
I'm anticipating we're going to see trillions of dollars flowing into this asset class over the
next four years. It's going to put Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of the decade in my view.
And this means right now it's very early. And the risk of Bitcoin today is not nearly as high
as it was four or five years ago. If you take a look at the total value of all the money in the
world, all the value of stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, oil, commodities, artwork, cash,
add it all up, all the money in the world, it's about $800 trillion. If everybody who owns all
that stuff, you, me, everybody, if we allocate just 1% of our portfolio to crypto, that's $8 trillion.
$8 trillion added into Bitcoin turns Bitcoin into $500,000 per coin. It's as simple as that.
It's just basic arithmetic. And that's a 1% allocation. If you think people will allocate 10%,
now you're talking about $5 million per Bitcoin. And that's how Michael Saylor gets there. Michael
thinks that we're going to get 10% allocations by institutional investors, governments, sovereign
wealth funds, et cetera. And if he's right, Bitcoin will be $5 million, not just $500,000.

time for crypto asset appreciation in my opinion. And a lot of people are looking at the market and
realizing that this thing's about to blow.
