Big news is shaking up the crypto world. Last week, the Genius Act was signed into law,
marking a pivotal moment for the future of stablecoins and for cryptocurrency exchanges.
The groundbreaking legislation sets strict rules for stablecoin issuers,
requiring 100% reserve backing with liquid assets, monthly public disclosures,
and new consumer protection measures. It's a game changer for the industry,
bringing legitimacy, transparency, and trust to a space that's often been clouded by uncertainty.
But what does this mean for crypto exchanges, the future of stablecoins,
and the millions of users navigating this rapidly evolving landscape?
To break it all down, we're joined by two voices from Byconomy.com,
a global cryptocurrency exchange with over 5 million users across 200 countries and regions.
Diane Magans, Senior Marketing Officer and Breno Sperandillo, VP of Partnerships,
will share their insights on how the Genius Act is reshaping the industry,
the opportunities it unlocks, and how Byconomy.com is staying ahead of the curve.
We'll also dive into the current state of crypto, the ongoing challenges on the horizon
of crypto regulation, and what's next for the future of digital assets.
Welcome to the Defiant Podcast.
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to the Defiant Podcast. I'm your host,
Vinnie, and we are joined today by Diane Magans and Breno Sperandillo.
Thank you so much for being on the podcast, guys.
Thanks for having us, Vinnie. It's a pleasure to be here.
Yeah, so let's jump right in. So for those of you who may not be familiar,
can you give us a quick overview of Byconomy.com and what sets it apart from other cryptocurrency
exchanges? So our exchange is a centralized crypto exchange, and it was established in 2019.
So we are on the market for five plus years already. And until now, and to this moment,
we are ranked between 20 to 30 centralized crypto exchanges on Bitcoin market cap.
And to be exact, we're 27th at this point. But you know, the rankings jump down and up,
so it changes. And we offer more than 15 products, and like usual ones like sport,
futures trading. Then we have our specific products like Byconomy Kickstarter,
Byconomy earned products, and many more like copy trading and trading tools and others.
Our then 300 coins are available for trading currently, and new coins that are listed
constantly daily. And especially now when the market is booming. So this is a good to know,
but you know, also the coins, one, the ones are listed, and the others are delisted. So it's a
constant flow. But in average, it's 300 coins. And we are proud for what we have achieved by now.
We have established a lot of partnerships, but on that we'll elaborate more. And then
we have quite solid user base. It's more than 500k active users on our platform. And actually,
yeah, these are our main milestones. And furthermore, we will achieve more.
Yeah, I think that my favorite things about the platform are first, the earned products that works
as a training wheels for users to kind of start playing around with DeFi stacking and feel what
DeFi environment would look at. And centralized exchanges are actually the first platform that
a regular user would go through. But I mean, the main strength from my perspective is our global
audience. We have so many communities and we communicate in over 20 different languages,
locally with local community managers. So we grasp this localization, this feeling that each
country has. And it varies from young ones that are here for meme coins and game coins, game tokens,
but also for all the way to the other end of the spectrum of professional traders that want to have
automatic trading and fast trading and reliable charts.
That's really great because people in different parts of the world are going to have different
needs that crypto can fill. And I think it's easy for us in the US to get very tunnel visioned on
what we need and not thinking about like, for example, the USDC legislation and how that's
going to make borderless payments great. Well, that means a lot more to people in Africa and
Latin America than those of us in New York. So awesome. So the crypto market has seen many ups
and downs lately. I'd love to hear how you guys would describe the current state of the industry
and just tell us a little bit more about what you're the most excited about as to where the
industry is headed. It's quite interesting because people perceptions about market and
their understanding of market is different, but I will share about my personal views and
based on how we operate in the market. The current state and the current stage that we are in is
very unique because many states, many governments, they turn to crypto space. Crypto industry cannot
be ignored any longer. There were a lot of initiatives that are leading to
increasing mass adoption of crypto among regular customers, regular people.
So it's very much interesting. You know, introduction of AI tools, AI agents, AI
opportunities in crypto space is also quite immersed. And even for crypto trading, you know,
what does AI is just amazing. And now with this stage where we are in, many think that it's
altcoin season has started or it's about to start. So everyone is just in a waiting mode
to gain as much as they can from this. Surely a lot will depend on policies on
our, on the US president's policies and actions and, you know, his steps towards crypto.
The current state is quite promising, I would say.
Absolutely. Brenna, what do you think?
Yeah, I would double down on that. I think the industry and the tech are more mature now.
And major changes are somehow interoperable, getting better and better every year on that.
Wallets have evolved to be safer and easier. We have named services. We have best practices
that we didn't have three to five years ago. So this, and we see this regulatory frameworks
allowing very large institutions to finally participate in these markets,
bringing more inclusion and reducing entry barriers for everyone. I don't know. I think
we're all very, very, very excited about the prognosis of cheaper, faster and better solutions,
becoming the dominant service level with stable coins, DeFi wallets, and of course,
the whole evolution of on-chain technology. Absolutely. And yeah, I think it's interesting.
A couple of weeks ago, we had Kadena's CEO on Stuart Popejoy, who mentioned, you know,
a lot of the time going for efficiency and cost savings is not necessarily going to be enough
to create the buzz that we need, unfortunately. But I think, you know, like Diane, you were saying,
we have not just efficiency, you know, cheaper, faster transactions. We're also talking about
a potential altcoin season coming up, right? So if you can have cheaper, faster transactions
and make 200% on your Doge or whatever that asset is, like now we're really cooking with gas, you
know? So Diane, I would love to ask you a couple of questions just specifically to, you know,
your marketing experience and how you're working with getting Byconomy.com's messages out. And so
the first one being about user experience. Byconomy.com is known for having a really great
user experience, which I think is really important because exchanges are not just about crypto
degens, right? As you said, we're going to have this being the first point of contact for a lot
of people as they are dipping their toes into crypto. So can you tell us a little bit about how
you ensure in your marketing highlights that this feature is, you know, easy to use and how
do you do that in order to attract both beginners and experienced DeFi traders? I would say that
simplicity and easy to use features and fast transaction is our superpower and our marketing
detects that. So we have highlight features like intuitive navigation and lightning fast
performance through product videos, then in-app tutorials, and we also interact with influencers
and we host our AMA sessions from time to time. So for new users, we have created a step-by-step
guide to work them through a QYC process and to make it easy for them to make their first
trade. If we talk about more experienced users, we have futures and support interface that is
friendly to them for their level, and then we have chats, and we have push-up notifications
for market updates and our XR account is also quite active page or account, whatever you call
it. So it's also quite active in bringing market insights into where market goes and what tokens
are performing the best and so on and so forth, but we also have these notifications on our website
and in the application. So actually it's just to make it easy, simple, and users to learn how
to do this, to learn how to make this process of QOS, to pass it smoothly, and then to teach
how to trade. That's great because I feel like there are a lot of people who their extent of
investing in crypto is buying Bitcoin, maybe buying an NFT, right? So it's still very much
that kind of first level of investment, and so it's really awesome to see that there are resources
to help people who, okay, maybe I bought Bitcoin and I want to learn about earning yields, or I
want to learn about farming or whatever it is, because I think those are the things that can
come off as scary even to the people who have believed in crypto for a while. So that's really
great. And then moving into what it's like to market in a regulated environment, you know,
I think this year is really unique in the sense that we have multiple bills that are being passed
across the world to help protect consumers and to give us the guideposts that we need in order to
continue to innovate. So with the Genius Act introducing marketing rules to protect consumers,
how is Byconomy.com adapting its marketing strategies to align with the new regulations?
I guess this regulation is awesome actually because it protects consumers first of all,
and this is our top priority to protect users, to protect their funds, to make it safe for them
to trade. We actually proactively built a compliance-first marketing workflow,
and that comes especially for the US and allied jurisdictions. So all promotional content now
with that bill is being reviewed, you know, just to ensure that we avoid exaggerated claims.
Right, of course.
For our users, so for example, we've shifted language in certain promotional materials,
you know, from earn quickly, just to trade cautiously and so on and so forth. And we also
embedded risk disclaimers in all major campaigns throughout this time. So we are now updating also
our geopolitical targeting rules, and we removed non-compliant features
in sort of sensitive markets. So actually, we believe that this helps us build trust
while we stay ahead of regulatory expectations. And for us, you know, if a user is not compliant
to trading rules that were earlier also introduced by, you know, other regulations,
earlier regulations, then we inform the trader that, you know, you are not compliant. You need
to readjust your strategy. So if they don't do that, then we imply certain measures also.
So this is also an effort to comply with the regulations. And there is a lot to be done
actually on compliance, especially in light of this genius act. I believe that we've done
what we could until now, and we are moving, we're still doing and will be doing what we can do to
protect our users and to save their funds. Yeah. And I imagine it must be a big workload to,
you know, stay up to date with each of the regions that you're covering and, you know,
what's legal here? What's illegal there? What are you allowed to say and do? So it's a big
undertaking, you know, and the ways in which the genius act, yes, will obviously impact your US
customer base, but who knows what the tailwinds are going to be there. So yeah, really important.
And I like that you're building on creating trust with the consumer base because that's what we need
in crypto, right? Like the worst thing that can happen is someone buys cryptocurrency and then
it's lost or something negative happens. Like a lot of people just need one bad experience and
they're out, you know? So it's really important, I think, to work on not only building loyalty with
your consumer base, but trust so that they want to be loyal to you. Otherwise, like who cares?
Yeah, I agree with you.
All right. So I'm just going to shift over to you, Brenno. Let's talk a little bit about
partnerships in crypto. They're obviously a crucial part of any business, but especially
here in the crypto space. Can you share any of your recent collaborations that you feel
have been really exciting or that have significantly impacted by economy.com's growth?
Yeah, but it's hard to pinpoint one specific partnership. The way we look at it, each
collaboration positively impacts our growth, especially token issuers. I would say first and
foremost, talking with token issuers and understanding why they're coming to us, what they expect from it.
We truly believe the way that we deliver market access, but we also believe the way that we
communicate with each community. So token being listed, they're bringing our community to us.
They need to believe in everything that the system is working properly, but also we will bring them
to our communities and to different countries and to understand what are the core values they want
to communicate, how they connect with them, what's their branding, their tone of voice, all of these
things that we will represent them in a sort of way. But some interesting things are also
offering staking to non-dex users, like I mentioned before, through their own action,
that users have access to those specific tokens and they see that as their saving account sometimes.
Depending on which country they are, they have a hurdle of doing with currency devaluation
every single day. So going through crypto, even sometimes certain meme coins that being around
and are not as volatile anymore, they could be an interesting tool for them if they're accepted in
their regions. But part of the conversation that takes a block of our calendars are regularly reaching
out to L1s and L2s, some VC, some market makers and specific communities to understand their
sentiment about the whole market, what they're looking at, especially with L1s and L2s because
they are the protocols, they are the home of everything that is being built. What is there
that we need to be ready to integrate soon? Or is there any way that we can help them to access
certain markets or even to get feedback from certain user communities? And of course, we're
going to talk more and more about it, but now there's a very strong new stream of stable coins,
but they're looking for liquidity and additional trading pairs because they want to have market
access. And some of them will try to compete with already large, very large and well-established
stable coin issuers. But some of those are trying to solve specific use cases in different regions
of the globe. Yeah, I think it's so important to footnote, right? Like a Bitcoiner and a Dogecoin,
Maxi are not the same consumer a lot of the time. So, you know, and kind of trying to figure out,
like, what do these people need? And for the generalist crypto investor, you know, you and
I were talking before about how, yeah, some of us just want to diversify our bags and have lots
of things going for us, right? So they're just like in any industry related to finance, there's
so many different consumers and like going to them to ask for what they want and what they need,
that just always goes a lot better than being like, here's what you need, buy it.
Yeah. And most of the time that behavior doesn't help, right? It doesn't work. You need to be
listening, you need to be attentive. Yeah, not the best attitude, but you know, well, we're community
first often, as cringe as that can sound sometimes in crypto, I do think it captures a lot of like
us changing what the expectation is of like the relationships between different entities.

So let's talk a little bit more about stable coins, because another thing that happened with
the Genius Act is now it opens the door for banks and for other entities to become licensed
stable coin users, issuers, which is pretty exciting. Do you see this affecting partnerships
and competition in the crypto exchange space? Yeah. Well, for sure, it raises the bar and pushes
the whole market forward. That's it. And hopefully it will raise the new tide, will raise all boats
with it. But my main hope is that Micra in Europe and Genius and Clarity Acts in U.S. will make
trade fighting banks to finally properly embrace Web3 instead of just turning their backs to it.
To this day, there are still very large corporations that completely block any
interactions with Web3 businesses or even users. Yeah, talk about attitude.
Right. So that's the first thing that I want to see change, because this is many people say,
oh, yeah, I want to do that. But my bank of choice or my two or three bank of choices don't
integrate to whatever you're offering or this specific game or this specific solution that I
felt attracted to. But I believe also that very quickly these rules will bring better integration.
I think that's the first thing that we'll see. We'll see instant transfers. When you start thinking,
and you mentioned this before, most people in America don't think too much about it because
most of the systems in America work really well. Certain other countries in the world
might share the same feeling, but most of the world struggles with anything financial related.
Some people still need to physically go to a bank branch agency that is far, far away. And then you
have specific time that you need to go there and that disrupts your working schedule, your family
schedule. If you're a large business that has cross-border operations or if you are a supplier
somewhere or an exporter, hurdles and more hurdles, not only with governmental rulings,
but the whole banking system that is still doing the same thing as, I don't know, 50 or maybe even
a hundred years ago. And let's not forget that the first use case besides Bitcoin or blockchain is
bringing trust to the system. So it will be more safe for everybody.
Yeah, exactly. Speaking of safety, I'd love to talk a little bit more about security.
It's obviously a big priority for Biconomy, as Diane was saying earlier. Do you ever use
partnerships as an opportunity to enhance the platform's security measures? And if so,
what does that look like? Every single time, every discussion, every conversation. It will
start with, of course, mapping expectations and opportunities and finding synergies. But the next
step, the next evolution, whenever the conversation gets serious is due diligence, is each establishing
trust on each side and then evolving to the fact that do we want to associate our brands? Do we
want to be publicly together? Do we want to have our logo appear on each other's websites and
how do we communicate throughout their communities? So that, and every single time, there's a little
bit of back and forth that I bring to our compliance or legal or the marketing to say,
we're doing this. Could we do that? Or why are we doing this? How do I justify? I have this question.
Let's jump on the same discussion and share why we think about this. So each partnership is a
building block of trust, I guess. We're always validating each other. And I like to say that
whoever is present in this industry for more than four years can easily note how most of the
exhibitors change every two years in the conference floors. So that's one thing. If you've been around,
you know, at least each brand validates each other. I love that. It's like D-Y-O-R or Bust
is so crypto. And yeah, it's just so great to me that so many people in crypto, especially those
of us who are trying to build a better financial system, build a better world, as utopian as that
might sound, the legislation is actually just catching up to us. We've already been doing
due diligence. We've already been doing all of the work that you need to do to create a secure
platform. This is just helping hopefully to weed out bad actors and to add that additional,
those guardrails that, you know, a lot of us have been asking for for over a decade, right?
So it's exciting to finally have it. It might not be enough, but government is slow, unfortunately.
So I'd love to switch back. I'll ask these questions to both of you, either of you,
whoever wants to jump in. Let's talk a little bit about the Genius Act's impact on crypto
exchanges, because there's a new focus on reserve banking and on transparency, you know,
transparency being a great part of the crypto industry. How do you think reserve banking and
transparency will impact the way exchanges like Byconomy.com operate? I don't mind, Brenna, if you
start. Okay. So polite. Thanks. I think of this as, I think you just, you answered the question
before asking it. I don't see much change for the exchanges individually. Yeah, because most of us
are already focused on best practices. We need it to be. We need it to build trust in the market.
And honestly, it's extremely competitive. This is a market that anybody can jump in. You know,
you have all kinds of trading platforms. You can build a white label that is not so expensive.
The expensive part of the thing is not necessarily the back end of the system,
is all the talent that you need to hire and spending time and knowledge to put the effort.
But I'd say to put the effort to make something proper and compliant. But I would mention one
thing. Legal and compliance department, we need to define what the diligence looks like when
stablecoin issuers in America are under the act. But then we will also have issuers from other
jurisdictions under different regulations. Do we need to build walls? Is this interesting for the
industry? We might evaluate things like we can have restrictions according to geolocation or KYC
for specific regions. But I don't think that that would be the best outcome out of it. I think we
need to search for more unity than separation. That's my two cents on this. You know, yeah,
you're taking it as unity, actually. But if we talk about this genius act, you know, yes,
certainly it brings transparency and clarity into crypto space. And this is what it was lacking,
actually. So now, if you could just repeat the question, because there were a lot of questions
and now I'm a bit lost. Yeah, no worries. So the question was, how does the genius acts focus
on reserve banking and transparency impact the way exchanges like by economy.com operate?
So yeah, I see. But for me, you know, I would say that exchanges would still need
to more effort, you know, to make this QIC process obligatory, you know, if some of them
haven't done it yet. Because for us, it's a must have because you are not fully functional
without this feature. And if you are not identified, you cannot withdraw money or trade and do
deposits, whatever. Actually, this helps to protect the users, the customers, and it helps to
battle these scams and the various, you know, if we talk about P2P trading, it also helps to
tackle those bad characters, characters easily. And, you know, also for us, US citizens now,
certain exchanges will need more transparency and more, you know, maybe they will require
some documents that prove their residents, you know, to be sure that this is a US citizen
or US resident. And we need to do something about this because we need to comply with
this act now. So I would say it helps. It brings the clarity and transparency, but it also requires
certain efforts, you know, to build and to rearrange sort of current things for users.
Yeah, absolutely. And I've already seen changes in some of the exchanges. You know, I was buying
some crypto on Coinbase and then all of a sudden they were like, oh, sorry, you can't pay with your
debit card anymore. You have to link your bank account. And so that's, you know, less than a week,
less than a week from the Genius Act passing. So it's cool to see that people are going to be like
moving very quickly in order to comply with the new regulation. And I think that's a really great
sign because, you know, no one wants to get sued. Nobody wants the SEC knocking on their door, right?
So I'll be curious to see like what else changes because that's something that's to be kind of
not very consequential. But I think as we continue to see, you know, like not only the Genius Act,
but the Clarity Act and other legislation being passed around the world, it will be interesting
to see how quickly people change. And then, of course, what new challenges will inevitably spring
up. This is crypto after all. So staying a little bit on the Genius Act, what do you see as like the
future of stable coins? Like there's obviously going to be a very big shift happening now that
we have all this regulation, a lot of mainstream news covering stable coins. So how is Byconomy
preparing to stay ahead of the evolving market as the role of stable coins also continues to mature?
A few things that we're looking at, not only the stable coin act and Clarity, but we've been
discussing a lot. And I think that we'll see a lot of our dreams becoming a reality that probably
we're going towards the direction that every single application will be seamlessly embedded
or connected or integrated to a Web3 wallet. And there's also a secondary, very strong
trend of tokenization, like the tokenization of everything, putting the whole world on chain. And
that comes in different levels, but most of it is already happening at a small scale. We know and we
can see projects that are already tokenizing airline, sorry, airline mileage, gas station,
grocery points program, loyalty programs, e-sports are already born into this tech,
automation art certificates, all NFTs, but chains of custody with pharmaceuticals.
All of this sports betting is now becoming prediction markets and all types of betting
are becoming prediction markets. But there's a lot of new trends that are natively or native
on chain and all that connects on blockchain and has a token. Therefore you can have your own
Web3 wallet. You have your address that will be soon enough connected to your bank account through
stable coins. So everything will move instantly between these things. But the main thing that
brings, that comes to my head when I look into this is we're seeing a popularization of AI agents
and AI, these agents, they're not going to talk to a customer support service from a bank
agency. They talk tokens, they talk blockchain, they move at a speed that it's not human and
they move, they do that in such a high volume. So as people get and these applications become
more supported by AI agents, this is the tech that these agents, this is the financial technology,
this is the financial tech stack that these AI agents will use. The way that we are, I think
I'm wearing this, is at Biconomy.com we're preparing for this. First thing, first of all,
understanding what our users like and what they want more of. And noticing their behavior,
paying attention to their journey in our platform, where they're coming from, which kind of iterations
and experimentations we make that they react well, quests, engagements, giveaways. And this
understanding is the driver for us to decide where our development team or engineers will spend their
efforts to improve the tech stack. This is also how our marketing campaigns change. And this will
define, this is something that I discuss regularly with the team on which new integrations we need,
what are the departments that I need to start pursuing to make our users happy,
thinking about that in mind. That's great. Diane, anything to add? I fully support what Brenna just
said. You know, for me, yeah, it's obvious that this act will move stable coins,
will move them beyond just trading. They will become, you know, like tools for general users,
you know, and for us to as an exchange, actually, because there will be a verified stable coins
that we can give an access to our platform and those that will not be sort of recognized,
then surely we cannot focus on them. So it will depend how the things will develop.
But I agree with Brenna that our main focus will be on what our people, what our users,
what our traders and community members would like to see on our platform. So we are adjusting our
policies towards this and serving our users' best interests. Yes, I love that because there's just,
there's so many options out there that it can be very overwhelming. And so it's nice to have people
who are qualified to be doing research and like putting this directly into their business model,
I think is something that a lot of people are going to really flock to because, you know,
we all have that like too much freedom becomes a little bit like strangling. So it'll be a team
effort going back to the unity idea, team effort to push this all forward. And I mean, you're
already seeing, you know, different exchanges offering yield on stable stable coins that
far surpasses what's available for a savings account. I think in the US, it's like half a
percent is the average yield that you can get in a high yield savings account in a savings account.
And it's like, that's not even beating inflation. Like why would, what's the point of that? And I'm
seeing USD go down in value, right? So it's like, it's kind of, I think when we look at how having
to, you know, peg USDC to USD, for example, that'll help the dollar. But I think when you
have these different tools that are offering higher yield, some places are offering, you know,
4%. Some places are as crazy as 20% yield, you know? So it's like, yeah, those are numbers
people are going to listen to. Diane, I'd love to switch to talking a little bit about the mobile
app and just kind of what your guys's thoughts are on mobile first DeFi. It's definitely something
that's gaining traction. I think in a lot of ways, because we have apps like Robinhood making mobile
so much a part of their business offering that it's like, you know, easy on the go trading.
So it's definitely a key feature in that sense. And Diane, I'd love to hear are there any strategies
that have been the most effective in driving app engagement, app downloads, and just helping
consumers with mobile? Yeah, we are constantly promoting, you know, our app, our application.
But what we've done when it was first developed, we launched a campaign where we offered the
people who upload it, who will upload our app, we offered them some rewards. And now, even lately,
just recently, we had campaigns when we requested people, users to rate our application in Google
app and Google Play. And then you have this iPhone app store. So yeah, we requested our users,
and we offer this opportunity to them because if they rate, they get rewards. And this is sort of
incentive for our users who use our application on a daily basis. And what we also do in marketing,
like Brenner, you know, he was an active promoter of our application when we participated in a number
of offline exhibitions and crypto events. So it was also one of the tools that we used. But besides
that, it's a constant promotion. I wouldn't say that there was a particular strategy that gave us
certain percentage, but when we launched this campaign helped us to onboard a lot of users.
So actually, when you offer people sort of some incentive reward, and so on, so forth, they are
more inclined to do things that you would like them to do. So it's worse. Yeah, it helps us to
promote the app. We are still understand that there is still a lot to do for our application
to make it even better for our users. So constant collaboration between tech and marketing and
technological. What if sending crypto felt more human? Pulse just launched Red Packets,
a new way to give tokens with meaning. It's gasless, gamified and claimable inside group chats
only. Think AirDrops meets social cues on chain. Backed by smart wallet tech and live across major
L2s, Red Packets turned communities into micro economies of gratitude and growth. No seed phrases,
no friction, just connection with value. Check it out at pulse.social.
So Diane, I know you've been marketing crypto for a long time before by economy.com. You're at
Binance. I'd love to hear just what are you the most excited about as far as working in marketing
in this industry in 2025? We have legislation. We have new all-time highs every day, it seems
like, with Bitcoin. It just feels like we're in a very different world than we were previously.
Given your experience in marketing for crypto exchanges for many years,
what are you the most excited about in the current moment? Wow, that's what I was saying.
It's hard to narrow it down, I know. Besides Bitcoin going to the moon, what are you excited
about? Yes, that's the most important one. What is the most people are excited about and be
included. But actually, crypto space is completely different from what it was before. It's a whole
industry now. It's a fully fledged industry and it brings in too many people. But what I'm excited
about is that crypto is so dynamic. For me, no other industry in the world brings these
dynamic changes into your everyday life. It's so instant. Well, it's very volatile and
things change very fast in crypto and you will sometimes feel like you are
somewhere behind with all the developments. Oh, yes. This drives me, actually, and I like crypto
for this. But as we speak about crypto, I am sort of scared, but I'm also excited about
AI, AI opportunities that are available at the moment for various functions and things to do.
AI and yeah, I would say that that's what can give us what we can't even expect at this moment.
And it's scary. For me, it's still scary what AI can do, but it gives him mercy.
Yeah, I'm going to be really interested to see how... I definitely think crypto is doing really
well because it has the possibility of riding the wave of AI. But I'm most interested to see...
I think that crypto technology, blockchain technology is probably our best tool against AI
going off the rails. And so I'll be curious to see... There are different companies that are
engaging with zero-knowledge privacy. They're talking about how we can commodify
online data and stuff like that and doing it through tokens. So I think it'll be really
interesting to see not only the kinds of tokens and financial tools that come out of the
collaboration in crypto and AI, but just it might be crypto that helps to keep AI in check. I have
believed that for many years so far. And if the government won't do it, somebody's got to...
And I guess it'll be the crypto bros again, saving the day.
So switching back over to you, Breno, I would love to just hear, are there any trends within
the crypto space that you are picking up on and that you're particularly zoned in on for 2025?
So many. I think that we're finally reaching decent UI. I think that's the first thing.
We have proper UI that people don't need to go through a very long learning curve anymore.
Most of the people can have a crypto wallet with their phone biometrics. That's the first thing.
We are reaching real interoperability between chains, that it's not so clunky. If I bought an
NFT here and I want to trade it for something else, I need to go through different platforms
to do it. Swap's getting better. And then we have AI agents that are learning everything and
soon enough they will be better than us at doing these things. And then we just ask them to execute
whatever we want. But there are two things that I think we've been seeing major movements towards.
So we all saw what happened with meme coins recently passed and we see decentralized platforms
going from amazing to bad and back to amazing again, like the dot funds of the world and their
token emissions. There are a few things that touched that point because those are cultural
movements. There is, and I've been reading into how strong it is the tipping culture these days
and how we have decentralized social protocols. So whatever we're seeing happening on Twitch,
it would be very easy to morph into something that is Web3 native. And we have some examples
of that already taken over. So making it easy for everybody to create a token out of a conversation
or a picture or you have a family day that you go to a sports event and you want to collect that.
And that's a new type of collectible. And of course, for us, we want to be the environment
that integrates all of it. If you want to trade this, collect, if you want to hold it in a safe
way, that's why platforms like us exist. And the other thing that I can't forget to mention
especially when we think about being about a global presence is providing access for everybody to
financial tools. And we keep touching these points, but we got, we have to remind ourselves
that in certain areas, if you're not an accredited investor, you don't have access to certain yields.
Like you were mentioning, you have to, you have your saving accounts from your bank. That is
boring. That is under the inflation rates that it's pushed by somebody, some manager that has
their own quota to reach. And right here, okay, there's risk and big numbers will have higher
risks, but there are, especially with the deregulation coming through, there are stable
ways or safer ways to earn yield or at least to be protected from the currency devaluation or to
build sturdy future plans that you trust they will come through instead of just placing bats
all over the place. Right. A little more strategic would definitely be great. And, you know, we were
talking before the podcast about, you know, obviously the Clarity Act is right here on the
horizon. So I'd love to hear Brenno, like we have the Genius Act in the bag. Awesome. What are you
most excited for as far as what will happen after the Clarity Act hopefully gets passed? I think
that the worst part of the industry are the bad actors. And it's still too easy to say,
this is a very complicated technology. You should just trust my words. And everybody, ordinary Joes
just need to, some of them trust. If you're playing the numbers game, there's always a small
percentage of people that will fall short for these things and believe whatever a random person
is telling them. And we've been seeing this throughout centuries. This is not related to any
type of financial technology or technology of some sort. I think, I don't know who said it,
but I saw some people saying this and I keep going back to the fact that I'm excited about
what we don't know yet. There's a lot of new solutions coming to old problems, probably,
that will be built on top of all these regulations that now a lot of people that were avoiding this
market or that had opinions but couldn't act on them will feel welcome. And we're eager to do more.
We understand the fact. We've been struggling for a few years to keep growing and to prove
that there's a reason for us to be here. And I think that's best to come. There was something
else with the Clarity Act that's not coming to my head right now. You'll have to send it to me
offline if needed. But yeah, going back to the... And Diane, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
You're so right, Brenno. That idea of not your keys, not your crypto. Yes, there's a learning
curve, but just do it. Putting all this responsibility on the consumer, it literally
never works. Something we have to borrow from marketing is the assumption that the consumer
is lazy. The assumption that you've got to make 10 to 15 impressions on someone before they
actually interact with your brand. All the stuff that we know about marketing, we know because it's
based on human psychology. It's something that I've really kind of butted heads with with people
where they just want to like, this is the great technology and everyone just has to adapt to it.
It's like, no, things work not because they're difficult, but because under the hood, they're
very complex. But the UX, the UI is super easy. Smartphones, the desktop, all this stuff that
connects us to the internet and connects us to each other. You make it so easy to use. That's
what makes it popular. So yeah, I think that conversation is starting to happen. I see people
starting to be like, okay, well actually maybe we should just make this easier and stop shaming
people for not caring about whatever the upside is. That's exactly. And I was thinking about this.
I think that's the thing. I think it just brought it back to me is let's see everybody using
crypto applications without knowing. I mean, it's happening in the back of your application.
You don't need to see it. I want it to be like, you know, 4th of July, we're flipping beyond
burgers and people are like, wow, this cheeseburger tastes great. Is it Wagyu? And I'm like, it's vegan.
Ha! Like that's the type of thing, you know, where you like literally can't tell.
So, okay, Diane might disagree. But to start wrapping up, same question to both of you.
I'll give it to you, Diane, first. What is next for Byconomy.com? Are there any exciting
developments, features, anything coming up that you'd love our audience to be aware of?
Yeah, actually, yeah, as crypto space is evolving, we are also developing constantly. First,
we are developing our blockchain and we have announced it earlier. So it's still in the
development space, but we are working on this. We have launched recently, but we are still working
on this AI trading tool, which will help our traders and users to trade more efficiently and
more smartly. So now we will definitely do more partnerships. That's, yeah, Brenna knows this.
But we are aiming at, you know, from the technological side, because we cannot forget
about technology as well. For the last year, 24, we've done many, many upgrades, system upgrades.
So we are working on this constantly and it's in the plans. Also, we cannot not to upgrade the
system and so on to make it fast, reliable and safe. And for promotional activities,
we are also planning many campaigns to attract new users and to keep our current users also.
As for participation in different crypto events offline, you know, for our users to meet personally
with our team and to be and make them sure that we are real people who are there and we are not
just sort of AI agents somewhere in the space. So we will continue with these efforts and our
is being built up for the next half months this year. And so these are actually, we will continue
listing projects that we see them as strong or, you know, like trending in the market or those that
our users would like to see on our platform. So this work will continue. Wonderful. And how about
you, Brenno, any partnerships in the pipeline that you can share with us? That I can share.
Yeah, I mean, well, we'll take doxing as well. You know, this is the Defiant after all. Give us
that alpha. There's something coming. There are some big things coming. We're having fun discussions.
Very, very interesting. And this is, I think I would highlight three areas that I'm looking
forward to see, you know, solidifying throughout this next week's months to come. There's more
integrations to having very good discussions. We're learning and we're figuring out certain
integrations that will be that at the end of the day, it's all about bringing utility to our users
or to certain communities. Second thing is I am extremely excited about AI. I know that I should
be scared, but I'm more excited than scared. Every time I think about, there are tons of things that
I want to do and I don't do many of them because there's not enough time. And especially rebalancing
my wallets, organizing portfolio, looking and getting the last updates of certain projects or
certain systems or certain protocols. With AI, it became so much easier and the tools that we're
developing will make this easier inside our platform, which is already directly created.
So you can just adjust your automated trading agent. So I want to see this become taking body
and becoming a reality. But also, and I kept thinking about this, I think after the NFC
Lisbon event, I had one conversation that was we do everything fast and we try to do as much as we
can online so we can savor the time that we spend together in real life events. And I think that's
how we kind of get the circle, you know, and one thing kind of brings new fuel to have this energy
and keep moving fast as much as we can. Yeah, I love that. I mean, you really can't underestimate
the power of bringing people together and allowing the social interaction to be the thing that leads
it. I mean, Brenno, that's how we met in Lisbon. So like, yeah, we've been online for a long time,
you know, crypto has been mostly online for a long time. So like, I'm really excited for what
Diane, you were talking about, about integrating consumers with the team, what you're talking
about, Brenno, just like, yeah, freeing up our headspace so we can really just be in the moment
because that's the hardest thing to do. For sure. All right, guys, well, thank you so much for joining
us here at the Defiant. Where can our audience find you guys and where can they learn more about
Biconomy? We've got many, many socials and ex our former Twitter. We are very active on that platform.
We have a telegram group where we're also daily communicating with our users and solving the
issues if they need them. Then we have many more social accounts and Brenno and I, you know,
it's Reddit and Discord and many others. Your website, website is a source of information,
official information about, about our exchange, www.biconomy.com. You can find us there and,
yeah, upload our app and we are also there. So it's available on Android, on Apple system. So
we are everywhere. You can find us easily. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's x.com slash
Biconomy.com or official website has everything else, www.biconomy.com. Then you find several
telegram groups in different languages. There's everything, Discord, all the platforms are there.
I love so much that you guys are multilingual because like that's something that a lot of
people have complained to me about working in crypto media for as long as I have. They're
like, everything's in English. And you know, a lot is lost in translation. Absolutely. It's
hard enough to translate, you know, a casual conversation, let alone something as nuanced as
this. Thank you so much, Diane and Vreno for coming on and we'll be following what comes next
from Biconomy.com. Thank you. This was really fun. Thank you for your invitation. Of course,
and hope to have you guys back soon. If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like and subscribe for
more content like this and join us next Friday when we'll be talking to Jordan Jefferson, founder
and CEO of MyDoge about how upgrades to the Dogecoin protocol can upgrade it from a meme coin
to a competitive platform for DApps and DeFi, just in time for DeFi Summer 2.0.
But in the meantime, stay tuned, stay informed, stay Defiant.
