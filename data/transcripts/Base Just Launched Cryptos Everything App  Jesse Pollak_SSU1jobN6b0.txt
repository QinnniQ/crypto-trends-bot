Welcome Bankless Nation to Bankless TV. On this episode of Bankless TV, we are covering
the base ecosystem. That's right. It's base day on Bankless TV. And to kick off base day,
we are bringing on the creator of base, Jesse Pollock. Jesse, good to have you on.
Thanks for having me. Excited to be here. Happy base day.
Happy base day. Yeah. Fridays are base day. And then every other base day, every other
day is base day as well. I believe that's how that works.
I think that's right. It is base era. So we like to think every day is base day.
I thought your guys' naming of your marketing, your announcement day of a new day one was
pretty clever because it's like, okay, it's actually the next, it's the next thing, but
it's still day one. It's still day one. It's the next chapter. It really felt natural
for us because we were unveiling a new brand. We were kind of bringing a new product experience
that led a lot more people in the world to actually experience base firsthand in a way
that's understandable to market. But I think with both of those, we felt like it was still
very early. We haven't solved any of the problems fully yet. We have, I think, a good line of
sight on how we're going to, but we have so much more work to do. And so that mindset
of it's still day one, we got a lot more work to do, is really important for the team.
My understanding of the base app is it is the just consumer front end to the base chain.
And so blockchains are plumbing. Blockchains are software. They are back end infrastructure.
But we know that they can be more than just plain dumb asset ledgers. They can do more
than that. And to me, when I saw the presentation of the base app, I was like, oh, this is,
this is Coinbase. This is Jesse putting a cosmetic interactive consumer pointing way
to interact with base. Is that how you think about it?
I think that's roughly right. Two slight shifts I would say. One is that we think that the
base app is going to be your front door to everything on chain. So it's not just base
chain. Base chain is like a component of the infrastructure, but we've really always thought
about base as being a bridge, not an island. We want to make it possible for everyone to
come and do whatever they want on chain, whether that's on base chain or somewhere else. And
so that's the mindset we're going to be bringing towards this.
And then to your broader point, I think that that's actually exactly right. The thing that
we've seen over the last two years is that we've really clearly articulated this vision
of bringing the world on chain, of building a global economy. But really the only people
who it's resonated with have been builders because they could actually get in the weeds
and like build on base chain and experience, oh my God, this is such a better developer
platform for all the things I want to do. And then they could connect that up to this
idea of the global economy and this new next generation of the internet that we're building.
But when we talk to our friends and family or the random person on the street, we were
like, we're building a global economy. And they were like, what are you talking about?
And we were then like, here's Coinbase wallet and like bases in here. And like, they just
didn't get it. We did not have a product that matched the vision. And really the way I think
about the base app is that for the first time, we have a product that matches the vision.
The base app isn't everything app. You can come in, you can post, you can earn, you can
chat with your friends, you can explore thousands of apps, you can trade, you can pay, and all
of it works in this totally seamless, interoperable, connected app that is available to anyone
in the world. And that I think is the first time where we've really had that consumer
experience where I could give that to my mom and I have given it out to my mom and my friends
and people immediately get it. And they're like, oh, this is fucking awesome. And then
they resonate with this idea of we're building a new global economy. We're building the next
generation of the internet because they can actually experience themselves firsthand.
In 2025, it seems to me there's a convergence of a bunch of different companies attempting
to build out a new social media platform. And I know the base app is an everything app.
And so it's social plus other things. And we'll talk about other things. But I want to
focus on the social side for just a moment. We have brewing rumors that Sam Altman and
OpenAI want to build out a social media application that goes hand in hand with chat
and you can kind of squint and you can integrate like world ID, his investment with world ID
into that same whole thing, like making sure a proof of personhood based social media
application. And then there's been a number of temps of just like, you know, next generation
social media apps, kind of as an understanding of like Web2 is like kind of cooked. Like my
Twitter experience is just so broken. The reply guys are terrible. You know, Reddit is, you know,
indistinguishable from bots, you know, Instagram, Snapchat, these highly social Web2 apps are
pretty buffered from the penetration of AI. But there's a lot of like Web2 social media
platforms that don't really seem to be trending in the best direction. And so that downstream of
that, there's been a lot of investment into building out a new social media app. And now
Coinbase and base have a social media app. If you look at you go open up the base app, I think that
would be somebody's like first impression if they didn't know exactly what's behind the scenes
here. They down there downloading this app and like, oh, this is a social media app. I think
that's probably a fair, pretty fair, justified first impression. How do you think about that
in the grand scheme of just like social media broadly? Yeah, well, I think over the last 20
years, we've seen that there's been so much good that come with social media on the internet,
right? Like for the first time you've given, you know, hundreds of millions of people a platform
where they could share their creativity, their thoughts, they could connect with people all
around the world. But at the same time, while I think that provided a lot of good,
the realities of the way those social media platforms worked meant that for the most part,
the creators who are actually bringing their creativity to the internet have kind of gotten
a raw deal in the economics of all of it. Like if you look at the economics, like creators earn
less than 5% of the overall earnings of these big platforms. And I think what that's led to is
basically you have this like bubbling discontent where people are feeling like, oh, there's some
good stuff here. But also there's something fundamentally broken in how this is working
for me as a creator, because I'm the one who's bringing my creativity to these platforms. And
then someone else is profiting off it. And so that bubbling discontent, that's something that I think
I hear and see in like every first conversation about the base app where people intuitively and
immediately get it. They understand, oh, the existing system is broken and we need to build
a new system. And this is the way we think about the base app. It's not just a new social media
app. It's really the first time where I think we've started to see what a social media app
and a super app can look like when it is built on open protocols. Base is built on Ethereum,
and then it's built on XMTP and Farcaster and Zora and Aerodrome and Uniswap. We've basically
stitched together all of these open protocols that work together because they're built on the
shared foundation and made it so that when you post in base app, you earn. Because the new
foundation, this decentralized foundation that we're building on is actually structured in such
a way that it's built for creators. And it's built for the people who are using the apps that they
benefit from their creativity. And I think that is this sea change that it's a little bit hard to see
if you're new to the space because it still looks the same. But it's almost like we've
swapped out the engine of the plane while we're still flying it. And now we have this new
foundation that we can build on that's going to unlock a ton of value for creators and I think
unlock a ton of just opportunity in terms of what we can do from a product experience perspective.
I think mini apps are a great example of this. One of the things we get from building on this
open platform is that we have these composable mini apps that just work in the feed and just
work in messaging. So you can be scrolling the feed and see something cool, tap it,
and immediately check out. And that whole experience is built by a third party developer
where they can control their user experience there. Then you can send that to your friend
in a group chat and they can do the same thing. And so I just think we're just starting to scratch
the surface on this, but I do think that we've kind of started like a shift that's pretty big
one to this new way of building. I'm going to share my screen here and show some tweets and
talk about some of the commentary that has come out of the announcement of the base app. So this
one is from Nikhil Eith. Just got a special invite to the base app. First impression would be it's
the everything app, payments, social apps, chats, crypto, you name it, everything is here. I think
that's kind of highlighting some of the maybe superpowers that I think you've integrated into
the base app. There's a lot of protocols that are integrated. Like you said, the base chain is
integrated, built on Ethereum. And eight other EVM chains, including Ethereum and Optimism and
Arbitrum and Polygon and Avalanche. And so again, we really want to make sure it's not just base
chain. This is an app that gives you access to everything in the on-chain economy. Solana and
others coming soon. Certainly. And that's just the chain side of things. There's also like the
Farcaster client. There's just a bunch of protocols that you've kind of just legoed together to build
this experience that other social media apps just don't have some of the superpowers you have
because you've integrated all these protocols, mainly money and tokens and finance and things
related to blockchains. And I thought this tweet was pretty cool. This is from a content creator
who makes a bunch of clips on Twitter. And he tweeted out, going viral on your first base app
post and immediately getting a stream of creator earnings is an absolutely insane onboarding
experience. And this man is just scrolling down saying like 0.01 ETH, 0.02 ETH receiving from
people onboarding into the base app. Now, this is- This is really a crazy experience. And this is
what we're seeing really resonates with creators. And it's not just Jack. Jack made a few viral
posts and I think he earned a couple thousand dollars. Another woman, Sierra, made a viral
post yesterday. She earned like $3,000 or maybe it was $8,000. I forget what. But the thing that
we're seeing is that that experience of even if it's just a few cents, posting something and then
immediately earning. And it's not like, oh, you have to get X followers. Oh, you have to live in
Y country. Oh, you have to wait 60 days for a payout. The immediacy of my content is valuable
and I'm earning for it is really, really profound. And that's something that's when creators come in,
that it's hooking them. And I think they're almost like feeling this realignment where
they're feeling this discontent with the existing system. And then they experience this post and earn
moment. And they're like intuitively grokking it. They're like, oh, I get it. Now I get it.
And I want to keep posting here. I think one thing that's really important about this is some
people are going to say, oh, but only some posts are going to go viral and you're going to earn.
They look at my creator earnings or Brian's creator earnings. Brian earned like $150,000 over the last
week of posting. I've earned like $30,000 over the last week of posting. And they're like, oh, but
Jesse and Brian are special. And the truth is that A, of course, you're not going to earn and go
viral on every post. That's just like social media. There's going to be a small number of posts that
go viral where you earn the outsized amount of your money. And then of course, people with big
audiences, I have 300,000 followers. Brian has, you know, however many million followers, they're
going to earn more. That's because they have more distribution. And so that means it's easier for
them to go viral. And so I think that, you know, people are looking for a reason why this isn't
going to work. And I actually think if you start to put the hat on of like, holy crap, look at how
well it's working right now when there's like so few people using this. And then extrapolate that
to like 100 million people or a billion people in the network, all interacting with surface areas
where it's all interconnected with this value layer. I think there's just so much opportunity.
We haven't really seen it get started. So we as a society have seen social media apps,
enough social media apps come where we kind of understand a little bit of the science about how
they grow. And there's like that rule of thumb out there that like the people that are big on Twitter
aren't necessarily big on Instagram. And yes, you can like port your audience. So like a big
Instagram earner can come to the base app, sign up and then get onboarded with a little bit of
just like a bump just because they're already they already have influence in one domain.
But really the big people on Twitter grew with Twitter and they invested in Twitter specifically
and they learned to make their tweets resonate with the form factor. And so, you know, there's
one there's one strategy for growing the base app, which is like, let's get some of the biggest
influencers and get them on the base app. But also there's going to be the organic strategy of,
well, this is a net new consumer behavior. There's going to be net new, you know,
people that are successful on the social media side of the base app that learn to
build content that resonates with the form factor of the base app.
Talk about the strategy of growing that cohort of people.
Yeah, 100%. And of course, we're going to go get existing creators with scaled audiences.
We're already seeing that, you know, like people are coming, coming over Gary Vee,
for instance. He's like so fired up about the base app. He's coming over, he's earning,
he's making money, he's getting involved in that. But I do think that you're actually
spot on that the biggest opportunity is for new creators. It's the people who have
creativity inside of them and have been looking for where to express it. And the opportunity for
them with base is to get in early and to start building an audience from the ground floor with
us. Because right now there's only a few thousand people in the base app and we build on Farcaster.
So there's probably, you know, another few 10,000 people kind of in the network overall who are
using it daily. But if you come in right now and you start posting, you start building an audience,
you have the opportunity to grow with us. And so I don't think you should be coming into the
base app and being like, oh, immediately I'm just going to have massive distribution.
Instead, you should be coming to the base app and saying, I'm early. And if I am good and early,
there is outsized potential for me to earn in this new network that's being built right here.
And the thing that we're looking for, so if you're out there and you're a creator,
the thing that I'll say to you is we are going across every single content vertical,
particularly video content, fitness, food, makeup, small business, like any content vertical,
you name it. And we're trying to find the up and coming creators who don't have a big audience on
the existing platforms. And then we're going to do everything we can to make you successful,
make them successful. Because those are the people who are going to help build this next
generation of the internet. And so if that's you, if you have a content type that you're really into,
but you don't have a big audience or you're not earning right now on existing social platforms,
come to the base app and we're going to help you earn. We're going to help you grow.
You're going to grow with us. And then you're going to benefit from this collective force
that's coming into this new economy that we're building. And the really, really important thing
about this is that you can be anywhere, anywhere, anywhere in the world. You can download the base
app, you can get started and you can get started earning. And that means that the opportunity is
basically open for everyone in the world. And it's a level playing field for everyone in the world
because you're starting at the ground floor. It doesn't matter where you're born. It doesn't
matter where you live. It doesn't matter what phone you have. You can get started. You can get
started earning and you can help us build this future. Ever wonder how industry leading companies

content looks like on the base app because I think Instagram or Snapchat or, you know,
pick your web two social. It aligns with a certain style of content and that style of content has
been optimized to go viral on Instagram or, you know, same thing for Twitter. Certain content goes
viral on Twitter and it wouldn't really necessarily go viral anywhere else. So if we're extending that
same lesson to the base app, there's going to be a certain form factor of content that is uniquely
suited to go viral on the base app. And it's going to leverage some of the features of the base app,
mainly those creator earnings, probably. And so the things that people are going to optimize for,
the posters, the content creators, creators are going to optimize for are going to be unique to
the base app. And they're going to learn how to truly optimize their income, optimize their revenue.
What do you think that looks like? What kind of content do you think you guys
are emergently optimizing for at the base app because you guys are just hooked into
chain features such as like creator earnings? Yeah. Well, the first thing I'll say is that I
do think a lot of people, their head goes to like, how do we do like these economic systems with the
creator earnings to like do something, you know, kind of crazy fancy there and that's going to be
the thing. And I'm less convinced that that's actually going to be the thing. Like what we're
seeing mostly from creators is that once they turn on the monetization, like they just stop
thinking about it. Like it's not this active choice where they're like, oh, now this is this
new mechanic. I need to go do it. And it's like consuming my head space. It's like, oh no, now
it's on and it just works and then money comes in. And I actually think that that's going to fade
more and more into the background as people just normalize the fact that your content is valuable
and you earn from it. And so I'm sure there's going to be interesting experiments, but I
wouldn't suggest that people get overly myopic on like, that's the primary thing to do.
The things that I think are going to go viral, two things that I think are kind of traditional
and then one that's novel. The two things that are traditional, like starting to go viral is
one video content. Like I just think video content like on Instagram and TikTok is going to work.
And you're going to be speaking to an audience. It's going to be more global. You're going to
have to figure out how to dial that in. But video content is really, really important. And like I
said, we're going across every content vertical right now and we're trying to figure out how do
we get a handful of really good creators in each vertical so that there's actually good content
for consumers to actually engage with. And so I think that that's the first thing. The second
thing is crypto Twitter, ship posting, whatever you want to call it, like a little bit high-minded
text-based posting that can kind of bootstrap off this network that's being built there.
I think that that's going to work successfully as well. The content format that I'm actually
most excited about that's totally novel is mini apps. And that's enabled by this kind of open
platform and enabled by the chain is you can build a mini app and you can distribute that mini app
through the feed or through messaging and it can go viral. And then that can be an experience that
someone is one tap away from where they can just get started doing the thing. And some of those
are little mini games. You can imagine commerce where it's like one tap checkout. You can imagine
all these other like little mechanics where people are earning and kind of like sharing
funds with friends. But that kind of ability to turn the post into this canvas that anyone can
build and that anyone can make a viral hook, I think that that's probably the biggest net new
form factor that will kind of open up the opportunity for people to build in a new way.
And so those are the three things that I'm most excited about. It's one video across a bunch of
non-crypto surfaces and content areas. Two, kind of like traditional crypto Twitter posting and then
three, mini apps and the viral potential that's baked into those. Make a viral mini app. I just
vibe coded some mini app that's capturing the zeitgeist, right? There was that one like vibe
coded find the couple at the Coldplay concert that went pretty viral and it had something like a
million users and it was this very kind of like stupid little app that people were having a ton
of fun on. And it was just vibe coded in an afternoon and it went viral. If I build that
app or some other app that goes viral, do I have access to that same creator rewards monetization
that like all the other content does? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And we're still trying to figure
out how to work all these things together, right? Like there's the monetization that's associated
with the post and the monetization that's associated with the app and then the monetization
that's associated with the reshares of that post. And so I will say it's still early,
like it's day one. We're trying to figure it out as we go. But the pieces are all there and now
it's mostly about kind of like stitching them together in the right form factor.
So here's just to give an example of this is right now on kind of all posts by default,
monetization is on. So that means it'll get coined, it'll trade. People can kind of speculate on the
attention. People can collect it if they want to support you and then you're going to earn fees
from that. When someone quote posts your quote, monetization is off. And that's like, we don't
want people to be quote posting and then like kind of stealing the value from other people.
But I'm actually not convinced that that's the right long-term solution. Someone yesterday said
when you quote post, you should pair the coin of the quote post with the existing coin.
Because that means that every time someone buys the quote post, what it actually is doing is
going out to the open market, buying the previous coin and then locking up in the bonding curve to
get the quote post. And so you kind of create this daisy chain where the quote post monetization is
getting fed back into the underlying post monetization. And so this is one of the really,
really cool things that's opened up from a kind of surface area perspective in terms of how we
can build by building all this on chain and by turning everything into a coin is that we can
compose all these coins. Zora is doing this in another way where you create a creator coin
that's kind of long running. And then each piece of content you post is paired with that creator
coin. And so that all demand for your content is also demand for your creator coin. We're going
to be bringing that into the base app as well, starting with letting people import those creator
coins so you can just use yours and it will be auto paired. And so that kind of mechanism and
the ability for us to kind of like route all of this value and compose it in new novel ways,
I'm so excited about the potential there. And I think there's a lot of stigma about coins that
we're still working through candidly. People are very fearful about them. But when you just look at
the surface area of what we can do with them, and then you look at the real world experiences that
people are having with them, like real creators, I think it's pretty incredible. And I'm just so
excited about the opportunity. Right. It sounds like you are trying to plumb together this network,
finding, tweaking the right balance of like, you know, we have algorithms and social in web two,
and now the same algorithm is actually more about like, okay, payouts. What's the right way to
balance a payout in the right way and orchestrate it? And rather that being the algorithm that goes
viral, it's the payout mechanism that's really the thing. It's the market. It's a free market.
The market is the algorithm. What we've basically done is we've taken all this content that we know
is incredibly valuable because people have built trillion dollar businesses around it,
multiple trillion dollar businesses around it. And we've brought it on chain into the free market
where before it was one corporation that was valuing that thing and then monetizing it through
things like advertising or subscriptions or whatever other monetization method that they
chose. And we're saying, no, now we're going to let the free market value your content.
And then we're going to kind of use the free market and all of the kind of like economic
off flows that come from the free market to reroute that value back to the creators and
back to the people who are engaging with the content. And we think that that is just a much
stronger foundation for us to build this next generation of social networks.
I think the concept of a market-based algorithm, social media algorithm, can nerd snipe a bunch
of people. And I'm looking forward to seeing that. Yeah. I think that there's a lot of like,
yeah, there's a lot of cultural stigma and resistance to this. But if you look at the
truth is what has the best product market fit in crypto? It's coins.
Yeah, always. And whether those are pump meme coins or those are ICOs, like it's always been
coins. And that's because it's the most liquid, most composable form factor. That's actually pretty
easy for people to understand. Like I was, I onboarded my trainer that I work with this morning
and I was like, yeah, like every post is an asset and people can buy it and you earn from it.
Your gym trainer, personal trainer, you're like, hey, download the base app and go viral.
We talked about all this stuff and I was like, yeah, the base app. And I was like, you can post
and earn and do chat. And he was like, can I get that now? It wasn't me forcing it on him.
Like for the first time, the messaging actually really resonated. And he just made his first post
and he earned like, whatever, $10 on it. And now he's going to keep posting fitness content.
I was like, we need more fitness content. $10 is enough. I do want to give a voice to the skeptics
for a moment. This is a tweet that's going around from Brooke Lacey who is just giving her honest
take about what she experienced as a creator. She onboarded the base app and she just basically
voiced a concern about people flipping coins that she created because she's a content creator.
And in order for her to get paid, she had to quote, I had to dump on them to get paid. And so
she's a creator. She minted the coin and she felt like in order to monetize the work,
she had to dump the coins. I think this is kind of what you're talking about, which there's this
stigma around tokens and all of this kind of stuff. But I think this is kind of giving a voice to
some of the people that aren't totally convinced about this model yet, where we are really
encouraging this consumer behavior that we've never really seen happen on its own before.
Collecting content inside of social media app is like a novel concept to basically everyone.
And I think crypto people understand it, but the rest of the world, it seems like we are trying to
really bootstrap this consumer behavior that we haven't seen before. So what gives you the
conviction that this is right? Yeah, it's a new consumer behavior and we have a lot more work to
do, A, to get it in the perfect form factor and then B, to explain it because it is complex.
But I do want to just respond to this directly, which is she says, and I had to dump on them
to get paid. And Aniri, who's leading our social team, just jumped in and replied and I replied as
well. But I want to be really clear to creators, you do not need to dump your coins to get paid.
And from where I'm sitting, I would not advise that you dump your coins. I think that it's
short sighted. There's two ways you earn. One is from the attention and the fees that are generated
whenever someone buys or sells your coin. And that's just a stream of value to you. Anytime
someone buys a little bit or sells a little bit, you're going to get paid. And then two is that you
earn 1% when you create that thing. And so, you know, whenever the attention is going up,
you're going to see more trading activity. And that's going to be this ongoing stream.
If you look at that and you say, oh, but this post is small, I didn't earn that much. Well,
not every post goes viral. Some posts are going to go viral. You're going to earn a ton from the
fees. Some aren't going to go viral and you're going to earn less from it. But the thing to know
is that if you don't sell, I think you're more likely to go viral in the future because there's
actually people who are going to want to collect your content. Because if you're selling every
piece of content, you're saying, I don't believe in this content. Investor relations, you know.
Yeah, a little bit. But also it's just like, you know, if someone was selling everything that they
got, I would want to invest in that content or back them either. And so again, I don't think
this is on her. We have to do a better job explaining all this. But my guidance, and I
think Iniri said it here is like, don't sell that 1%. It's not worth it. Like keep posting.
Some of your posts are going to go viral. You're going to earn. Brian Armstrong earned $150,000.
He sold none. I earned like $30,000. I sold none. Sierra earned like $3,000. She sold none. Like
people are earning a lot of money just from the fees. And I think that's the sustainable way.
Whereas a creator, you're monetizing your attention and then you're just holding your ownership
because it's cool to own your content. And if you just do that, then you can stop worry,
right? You don't need to be feeling like, oh, am I dumping on my holders? Am I doing something wrong?
No, you're not. All you're doing is earning from the attention. But you're holding your content just
like everyone else is. And that's something that you can be proud of because it's awesome to own
your content and to participate in this new system. Well, Jesse, congratulations on a brand new day
one. And right now I'm about to bring on Alex from Aerodrome right after you for the second
episode of Base Day. What should I ask Alex? What are you excited about Aerodrome? How does Aerodrome
fit into the base app? Or what do you think I should talk to him about? Yeah, I guess two things.
And one is just building on this conversation. You know, Alex was a skeptic about content coins
and kind of like how they worked and whether they would be good. And then he's kind of gone
full circle where he's actually a really big believer now. And so I think it's worth asking
him, like, what changed? What did he see? What was his experience? I generally find it's always
good to hear from skeptics who are kind of had their perspective changed just because,
you know, it's a new perspective. And I'll just say I was a skeptic too. The first time Jacob Horn
came to me and said, we're going to make everything a coin. I was like, that's crazy, Jacob. We're
definitely not going to do that. Too many coins. And through a lot of conversations and a lot of
product building and iteration, I realized, oh, this is actually a way better tool for what we're
trying to do. So that's the first thing. And then the second thing that I would love you to ask him
about is kind of how does he see the asset issuance on base evolving, right? You know,
one of the things I think is going to be really important as we're building this global economy
is trying to get every asset onto base so they can be traded. And we're seeing this happen with,
you know, international stable coins and with content coins. And I just would love for folks
to hear his perspective on like, A, how far we've come in the last two years from where we started,
and then B, where he thinks that's going. Because Aerodrome really sits at the middle of it. I think
they're hands on with all of these builders who are starting to bring their assets. And I think
I have a really good perspective. Jesse, thanks so much for joining me on Bankless TV. Thanks for
