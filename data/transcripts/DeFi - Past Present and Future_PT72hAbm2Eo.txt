The DeFi space is clearly at an interesting point. On the one hand, DeFi tokens lost up to 95% of
their value during the current market cooldown. NFTs and Metaverse have taken the spotlight,
and DeFi 2.0 lost its initial momentum. There were also a lot of exploits, regulatory uncertainties,
an unprecedented cult of individuals, and some questionable hires.
On the other hand, established protocols have been working like a charm, supporting a lot of
day-to-day operations. DeFi on layer 2 is just getting started. Multichain DeFi and DeFi on other
chains are also going through a rapid growth phase. With all of this, is it possible that
the worst is behind us, and we are at the brink of a DeFi renaissance? You will find answers to
this question and more in this video. Before we begin, if you want to learn more
about decentralized finance and the technology behind it, make sure you subscribe to my channel,

been kind to DeFi. Despite the amazing innovations and growing total value locked across DeFi
protocols, the prices of DeFi tokens didn't reflect this. Even when the DeFi tokens appreciated in
value together with the overall market, in most cases they still underperformed ETH.
The attention was focused on other things, NFTs, meme coins, metaverse, alternative L1s,
and NFTs again. DeFi 2.0 brought a bit of hope, but eventually resulted in a market over-exuberance
and a painful price correction. Ethereum Layer 2 scaling didn't arrive as quickly as most people
expected, which created a great opportunity for other chains. The ease of deploying to other EVM
compatible Layer 1s resulted in the creation of a multitude of forks of well-known DeFi protocols,
such as Uniswap or Aave. Olympus became probably the most forked protocol of them all,
fueling seemingly never-ending Ponzi games across all possible EVM compatible chains.
The unprecedented cult of individuals didn't help either. Maybe, just maybe in the space where
anonymously written pieces of code can process billions of dollars worth of transactions,
we shouldn't pay so much attention to individuals and focus on what is really important,
code and communities. It's been shown time and time again that the cult of an individual can
disperse as quickly as it can rise. There were also a lot of discussions around morality in DeFi.
Should a convicted criminal involved in fraud be allowed to anonymously work on a protocol
without other people knowing about it? This question might not be as easy to answer as we
may think. For some people, especially coming from traditional finance, that would be something
unacceptable. For others, being a good contributor to the ecosystem is what matters, and they believe
that people should be allowed to recuperate. One thing is clear, no one working on a DeFi protocol
should be able to single-handedly access people's money, no matter who they are.
The past hasn't been great on the hacks and exploits side either. Poly Network, Compound,
Crimfinance, Badger, to name just a few. Ragpoles haven't slowed down either, with hundreds of
forks created for the sole purpose of stealing money from the users. The wormhole bug alone
resulted in a $326 million loss that was fortunately covered by one of the biggest
participants in the Solana ecosystem, Jump. The overall hacks and exploits from the beginning of
2021 totaled at roughly $2 billion. There were also quite a few very close calls.
A bug in sushi discovered by DeFi researcher and white hacker Sam San could've potentially
resulted in a humongous loss of up to $350 million. Kudos to Sam San for disclosing the bug
in a professional and timely manner. Unclear regulations around DeFi and crypto as a whole
was another widely discussed topic that resulted in a lot of uncertainty for users, investors,
and founders. Countries banning and unbanning crypto, tough laws trying to fit DeFi into the
existing financial rules being voted on, and much more. Although regulatory uncertainty is still not
totally behind us, other previously mentioned things can be considered as relics of the past,
and definitely something to learn from. Now, let's talk about the current state of DeFi.
According to DeFi Llama, the total value locked in DeFi is hovering at around $215 billion. This is
slightly down from $255 billion at the end of 2021, but still remains high. When it comes to
decentralized exchanges, monthly trading volume has been at around $50 to $60 billion. This is
down from over $100 billion at the end of 2021. Despite a few new entrants into the AMM space,
Uniswap market share remains extremely high, at around 75% of the overall volume.
When it comes to lending, liquidity on Aave across 7 different networks is hovering at around $20
billion at the time of making this video. This is down from $31 billion at the end of 2021,
over fewer networks. Although on the surface it may look like DeFi has stagnated for a while,
in reality this can't be further from the truth. Major DeFi metrics like total value locked across
all DeFi protocols or volume on decentralized exchanges doesn't show us the whole picture,
as they are always correlated to the current market conditions. We have to look a bit closer
under the hood to understand what is being built when no one is watching and what kind of impact
it can have in the future. Layer 2 scaling is clearly one of the big developments and can
dramatically increase the adoption of DeFi by lowering the cost and increasing the speed of
transactions. Optimism and Arbitrum are improving their code, making them cheaper and cheaper to
use. Polygon has acquired a lot of scaling solutions, including ZK rollup tech like Hermes,
Nightfall and Maiden. Starkware, after successfully scaling single-purpose protocols
like DYDX, Diversify and Immutable X is working on a more generalized ZK rollup called Starknet.
In the meantime, other chains are not slowing down either. DeFi on Avalanche, Phantom, Solana,
Terra and others is also going through a rapid growth phase. Although at the moment DeFi protocols
on these chains, especially the EVM compatible ones, are mostly forks of protocols built originally
on Ethereum, there are also a lot of new things being tried and built. Despite some initial
criticism, we can see the multi-chain thesis playing out and coming to fruition. In the search
for yield in DeFi, users are keen to bridge their assets into other chains. It all looks pretty
exciting, but we need to remember that bridges are inherently problematic. Transactions on two
different chains guarded by different consensus mechanisms cannot be easily executed as one atomic
operation, so it requires either trusting more centralized bridges or relying on networks of
relayers instead of the actual consensus of the two chains we are bridging in between.
Bridging to layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimistic or ZK rollups is a bit more secure,
as most L2s have escape hatch mechanisms that allow withdrawing funds directly from L1 Ethereum
if something goes wrong. Projects focusing on multi-chain, like Cosmos and Polkadots,
could also be interesting solutions, as the bridging transactions are usually secured by
one consensus mechanism, but it doesn't solve the problem when jumping between two different L1s.
When it comes to DeFi 2.0, despite the market overexuberance, certain mechanisms of this
paradigm shift, mostly around incentivizing liquidity, may prevail. Protocols like Tokamak
are maintaining a strong TVL of over 1 billion dollars and introducing new useful features to
the overall DeFi ecosystem. It remains to be seen if other DeFi 2.0 protocols, like Olympus,
will be able to shine again and come back to their original power. At the moment, the market cap of
the Olympus token OM is essentially backstopped by its underlying protocol control value of the
treasury, so to a certain extent it works as expected in the worst-case scenario.
The more established protocols haven't rested on their laurels either. Aave has recently launched
version 3 of their protocol that introduces better capital efficiency and improves risk
management. Bancor has also announced version 3 of their protocol that reduces the cost of trading,
allows for unlimited deposits and provides instant impermanent loss protection.
Thorgen has recovered from its hack and recently introduced synthetic assets aiming at increasing
network usage, network TVL and pool depth. It also allows for cheaper swaps and greater income
for liquidity providers. MakerDAO is discussing a new aggressive growth strategy, which would
include things like expanding into more real-world assets. Sushi is working on Trident, a framework
for creating AMMs and Shoyu 2.0, an NFT marketplace. Curve, which is fueling most of stable asset swaps
in DeFi, is not slowing down either. Its tokenomics model incentivizes a lot of other players to
compete for the CRV yield. The process, due to its competitiveness, has been called curve wars.
The CRV model became so popular that it's being copied by a lot of other protocols in the ecosystem.
When it comes to Ethereum itself, EIP 1559, despite the initial worries, has been working
like a charm and burning ETH every day. We have recently crossed 2 million of ETH burned
since the change was deployed. There's also been a big rise in liquid staking.
Lido, the dominant player in this category, has over $8.5 billion of ETH staked.
They also support staking on other chains, and their Luna staking grew to an astonishing $7.5
billion. Rocketpool, which chose a harder path and decided to start in a more decentralized state,
is also showing an amazing growth, with almost half a billion dollars of ETH staked. Although
not exactly DeFi per se, NFTs, Metaverse and crypto social media, including the Lens protocol
launched by the Ava team, has been a hot topic of discussion. This can bring more people into the
crypto space and allow them to also discover DeFi. On top of all of this, it's worth mentioning that
even during a market cooldown, when users are less prone to invest in new projects,
venture capital does not sleep and pours billions of dollars into the DeFi ecosystem and crypto as
a whole. This provides early projects with enough capital to focus on building instead of thinking
how to survive until the next bull market. As we can see, despite the market downturn,
the DeFi ecosystem is flourishing and this won't stop here. Let's have a quick look into the future.
One of the widely discussed events that is coming closer and closer is the Ethereum merge.
The merge will transition Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake and dramatically reduce
the ETH issuance rate, which can most likely cause ETH to become deflationary.
The merge is currently estimated to arrive between June and August this year,
but this of course depends on further testing. This is one of, if not the biggest changes to
the Ethereum protocol, so it cannot be rushed. The merge drives one of the current narratives
for Ethereum and may result in the next bull market for ETH and DeFi. There are also a lot
of other improvements in Ethereum's pipeline. EIP-4488, for example, can drive down transaction
costs for rollups by lowering the gas cost of call data. L2s are another catalyst that can result in
users rediscovering DeFi. Not only will DeFi be cheaper and faster than ever, it will also enable
new DeFi protocols that were previously not possible to implement on Ethereum itself.
Most L2s also have a secret weapon. They can always launch a token and quickly incentivize
growth. I wouldn't be surprised to see some inflection points that will cause all major
L2s to launch tokens one by one in a very short period of time. There are a lot of teams working
on L2 scaling, but one of the highly anticipated events is the full launch of Starknet that will
provide a general purpose ZK rollup. NFTs Metaverse and DAOs can also fuel DeFi, which could become
the backbone of these nascent ecosystems. Tokenizing NFTs and trading them on an AMM,
this is DeFi. Creating escrow contracts to exchange tokens between DAOs,
DeFi. Trading parcels of land in the Metaverse, also DeFi. Even NFT marketplaces can be considered
as decentralized finance. Another segment of the DeFi market that may experience rapid growth
are indexes. In traditional finance, indexes such as S&P 500 and FTSE 100 went through a huge cycle
of growth and became a huge part of the overall market. This hasn't been fully leveraged in DeFi
yet. I wouldn't be surprised to see more and more focus on indexes in DeFi, especially since the
nature of smart contracts allows for easily creating a wide range of indexes, from DeFi
to Metaverse to NFTs. It also allows for automating rebalances of these indexes.
Index co-op with its DeFi, Metaverse and other indexes is one of the prominent projects in this
category. One thing that we need sooner rather than later is clarification around laws and
taxes in DeFi. The current unclear rules stifle innovation and create an adversarial environment
for DeFi founders and users. We cannot allow this space to become a bedrock for financial
surveillance and unfair treatment so common in traditional finance. In the end, I believe that
most liquidity will move on chain and DeFi will attract most banks, hedge funds, other financial
companies and maybe even whole countries. Although there will be a long tail of chains, each with a
functioning DeFi ecosystem, naturally the liquidity will concentrate around a handful of chains.
When it comes to the market, it's hard to say what will happen to the price short to medium term,
but I wouldn't be surprised to see DeFi tokens having another resurgence
when the world wakes up to what is being built here. The decentralized finance space, despite
the current market cooldown, keeps evolving with astonishing speed. When the attention moves away
from prices, the long-term builders keep delivering value and keep coming up with fresh ideas that
later fertilize the next market cycle. During these seemingly quiet periods, it's extremely
important to stay up to date with the latest trends to benefit the most when the attention
eventually comes back to DeFi. Fortunately, whether it's MEV, bridges or something we
haven't yet discovered, Phenomatics will be here covering all these interesting topics in future
