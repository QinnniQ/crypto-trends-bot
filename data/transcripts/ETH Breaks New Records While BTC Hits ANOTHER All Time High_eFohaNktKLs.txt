Bankless Nation is the third week of July. It's time for the Bankless Weekly Roll-Up.
David, it is crypto week this week, okay? That's just not, that's not just me saying
it.
We're talking crypto this week?
Yeah, no, this is Donald Trump declaring it crypto week. He said, happy crypto week.
Did you see this?
Where did he say this?
You said this on Truth Social?
Oh, on Truth Social. Yeah, yeah. And the reason why is because the genius bill is in front
of the House, as well as the Clarity Act, some other House bills for crypto. So he's
declaring you and everybody at Bankless a happy crypto week. We got to talk about the
genius bill.
It is a happy crypto week. I felt that actually this week.
Okay, so the genius bill, the time of recording, we don't know whether it has passed or not,
but I'm going to go ahead and say it passed, okay? Bankless listeners, they're living
the future. We're recording this on Thursday. The bill is going up for vote at 4 p.m. today.
We don't know the outcome yet. You guys do. I think it passed, David, okay? Hold me to
that prediction.
I'm assuming that it's passing, it's going to pass. And also, I don't think that that
is why the market has pumped, especially Ethereum has pumped. I think that the market will pump
more as a result of this passing in the future.
After it passes?
After it passes.
Oh, it has passed, of course.
It has passed, it has passed.
Yes, yes. Also, we got to talk about Bitcoin, hit an all-time high. We got another all-time
high week back to back, but I do feel like all eyes are on Ether this week because there's
been a-
It was not a Bitcoin story this week.
No, there's been a vibe change. We talked about that last week, but now we've got ETFs,
ETH ETFs breaking all-time high records. We also have Tom Lee saying he wants to buy 5%
of all ETH supply. That's a true story.
How much? That's like 6 million Ether, and he is not anywhere close to 6 million Ether
right now.
No, he's got to work his way up, but he's getting there.
And then, of course, I'll cover the PumpFun ICO because we don't want Ryan to do that.
How'd it go? Who bought in? What happened afterwards? And then Coinbase launched its
Everything app, brand new release out of Coinbase. We're entering in the world where crypto companies
like Robinhood, Coinbase, they are doing their own internal jazzy marketing campaigns, marketing
streams like Steve Jobs-esque. They're doing their own roadshows in their own kind of context,
which is pretty cool.
We're going to talk about the Roman Storm trial as well. And remember that one time
the Polymarket founder got raided by the FBI. We're going to hear more about that story
as well.
But first, before we get into the markets and talk about all the different ETH treasury
companies that are up like 40% on the week, we're going to first talk about fundamentals.
And all those fundamentals you're going to hear are at the Bankless Summit. The Bankless
Summit is a one-day event that we are throwing at DevConnect. We are recruiting all the
greatest speakers in Ethereum to give 20 to 30 minute talks, no panels, just straight
information about Ethereum. The newest speaker is Donna from L2B. He is joining the ranks
to talk about native rollups and all the research that he's going there. But we've also got
Justin Drake, Ansgar, Tamash, Arjun, Uma Roy. It's going to be a who's who. It's a TED Talks
for Ethereum, the second day of DevConnect.
So if you are going to DevConnect in Buenos Aires, which I highly recommend because all
you're going to go do is you're going to go down to Buenos Aires, you're going to talk
about ETH, you're going to eat steak, you're going to drink Malbec, and then you're going
to talk about ETH or some more. I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to go to Buenos Aires.
They are the people that adopted stablecoins and Ether. They are the people that built
MakerDAO. They are the people over at Open Zeppelin. It's a great place to just be a
crypto person. And then once you're done being a crypto person, you just eat steak. It's
great.
Anyways, I'm very excited about it. This is again happening the Tuesday of DevConnect.
Get your tickets before I increase the prices. Prices are $80 right now. They will not be
$80 in the future. They are going to track ETH. And so they will be about $160 by the
time we run around to DevConnect.
That's an ETH price prediction, okay? That's a $6K ETH if I'm running the math right. No,
$7K ETH. Oh my God. Wow. We are bullish on the week. Let's talk a little bit about Bitcoin
price because we got an all-time high this week. Not quite at the time of recording,
but previous to that, what did we hit and where are we at right now?
We are currently coming in at $19,000. Bitcoin is up 7% on the week. A good old 7%. The new
all-time high, $122,800. I think it did hit $1,000 to $3,000. $100,000. So a pretty good
number there.
Some charts I guess.
Yeah. It fell off all the way. All the way it crashed, Ryan. Bitcoin crashed this week
from $123,000 all the way down to $116,000 and has since come up to $119,000.
See, they always told not to buy because it would crash.
It always crashes every time.
Not only that.
Well, you know, part of the story of this cycle, of course, has been the infinite institutional
bid for Bitcoin, the asset. And you're seeing that in no better place to see that than in
BlackRock's iBit. So BlackRock's iBit, of course, is the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. It just became
the fastest ever to hit $80 million in AUM. And David, I got to tell you, it's not even
–
$80 billion. $80 billion.
Oh my God. Did I say million?
You said million.
Yeah, I don't know what Bear got in your mind.
Okay, but look at this chart. It's like, oh, it's the fastest ever. Okay. Nothing else
is close.
It's four times faster than the nearest competitors.
It looks like –
All the nearest competitors are all within a pretty similar range to each other, pretty
neck and neck. And then Bitcoin is like, I am four times faster than all of you.
This is why Wall Street is so bullish on crypto assets this cycle is because they're
providing a lot of the capital flows here. The question is, is Bitcoin fair market value
or not? Well, if you look at some charts, like the long-term holder net unrealized profit
and loss, the nipple, okay, this is basically how up our Bitcoin holders, I believe it's
a measure – it's that kind of measure. We're actually not in froth market territory,
okay? We're between point –
The nipples are not frothy.
Yeah, the nipples are not frothy, not yet at least. We're somewhere at point six nine
and that's the below the zero point seven five percent.
Have I been sabotaged with this week's agenda? My God, is this even a real metric? Forget
this. Let's go to the classic rainbow chart.
I like this part much better. This is the classic Eric Wall rainbow price chart. It's
way easier to understand than long-term holder net unrealized profit loss. What the fuck
is that? No, you just look at the rainbow chart. We are clearly still on the lower side
of the rainbow chart. We are in accumulation zone. We are not in the massive deal. We are
not in the fire sale. We are not in the buy buy buy section. We're in the accumulation
zone, which is a modestly leaning bias towards buying, but not overly so, but we are definitely
on the lower side of the bitcoin price. What we want to do is we want to get into the yellows
and oranges slowly. We want to get into the yellows and oranges in like 2027, which would
put bitcoin somewhere between one and two million dollars. If we got to the orange red
area where like FOMO is happening and then also it's a sell signal.
This is a much better – I feel set up. I think I was set up with this week's agenda
talking about – I gave you the opportunity to kill the nipples in the car, but you just
walked right into that. All right. You want to talk about this. There's a new denomination.
I think this is so cool. We all like to talk about price. Bitcoin is only 21 million. Price
targets, blah, blah, blah, blah. There's also the cultural element of bitcoin acceptance
and the tolerableness of bitcoin. This is an indication that bitcoin is just becoming
so understood. Do you remember the first time we got into the Bloomberg terminals? That
was huge. That was a huge moment for us, right? Bitcoin was like $3,000 or $7,000 or something.
The cool thing that's happening right now, maybe this is small. Maybe I'm over hyping
this, but if you want to go look at bitcoin in the Bloomberg terminals, the pricing chart
on the right side, like the graph where you see the prices, the little tick marks, they
are denominated in millions of dollars. Right now, on the price of a bitcoin according
to Bloomberg, when you go up and open up Bloomberg, you see a bitcoin price of $0.112 million.
Not $112,000 or whatever. You see it denominated in millions of dollars, which means if you
implied it's going to be worth millions of dollars. It wouldn't be worth a million dollars
if people don't assume it's going to hit one point something or two point something. The
fact that we are denominated publicly on mainstream society, that we are denominated bitcoin in
millions of dollars, I think is a huge historical and cultural milestone.
I choose to believe that. And also, you need to make room on the graphs, right? So every
10x, you got to move the point somewhere, right? So pretty soon we're going to denominate
in like, what, tens of millions of dollars? Is that what's next for bitcoin?
Well, I mean, I think bitcoin needs to get to a million dollars and then we can start
talking about that.
Yeah, this cycle. You think that's happening in this cycle?
Well, what I just said, yeah. Sometime in 2027, one to $2 million bitcoin.
That's what the nipples tell you or the rainbow?
That's what the rainbow tells me. But the nipples are also pointing in that direction.
We've got enough here. Let's get to the ETH price on the week. Tell us about ETH price.
I am very excited about this number, but why don't I let you say it?
The number, the number for ETH, $3420, up 23%, not just double digits, but double digits
with a two handle on it, mostly driven by massive ETH treasury accumulation.
I woke up every single day to three different ETH treasury companies announcing their
purchasing of somewhere between $10 and $300 million of ETH.
And I got confused as like, OK, was this yesterday's announcement or is this tomorrow's
announcement? Which announcement is this? Is this a repeat from the last one?
Which BTCS, like MNBT, like treasury company is doing this?
I don't know. They're all just buying.
Each one is buying like somewhere between like 20 and 10.
I think it's like 20 was the smallest number that I heard, like $20 million.
And then the largest I heard is like $300 million.
But it just happened. It was just a big week.
And then and on top of that, we're going to talk about this, ETH, ETF inflows had its
largest number ever. So BlackRock, ETH, ETF took in $500 million of ETH for a total combined
$700 something something, $700 million of inflows.
$726 million yesterday.
That's all time. That's the biggest inflows ever for ETH or the asset.
By far. Yeah, by far.
It was a big week for ETH.
Really big week. Also, kind of close to flipping Bitcoin on that on the daily.
Remember, that's kind of in terms of daily, which is already massive because Bitcoin is
still four times larger than ETH right now.
It is massive. We've got some other measures of that.
Maybe we'll just talk about that for a second.
So this is Nate Jirassi saying we have record daily inflows for spot ETH ETFs.
Nearly $720 million.
Obliviate the previous mark of $430 million.
Obliviate. Just Obliviate.
Obliterate.
I'm using Harry Potter language.
That's how bullish I am. OK.
If you want to get into Anthony Cissano level bullishness, though.
Oh, yeah. You can look.
I don't know. You can't go any higher than that.
You start. Yeah, that's Max.
That's like, you know, your power maxed at Anthony Cissano, you know, bullishness.
So he likes to do this and he's been doing this on the daily basis.
He likes to take the net inflows and then he looks likes to look at the the the net
issuance. So we got net net inflows.
Of about $720 million.
And do you know how much ETH supply was minted that same day, David?
Not that much. Less than that.
Six point seven million.
OK, so I'm not going to use the words ultrasound money here
because that's not what we're talking about.
But we are talking about
like a lack of supply in this market, because this is the demand.
The inflow demand was 110x the amount of supply issued.
OK, so much so that there are reports
where I get that of OTC desks running out of ETH.
OK, this is what you just said that winter mute said.
Yeah, we don't have any ETH on our desks.
Everyone bought it.
Kind of nitpicky about Sassle's tweet.
No, this is a this is bull mode.
We'll allow it. OK, you get one one bearish thing.
This is what he's doing is he's he's like kind of using the whole this happened
with the early days of the Bitcoin treasuries, too.
But the difference here is, well, actually, actually, wait a second.
This is a bullish interpretation of Anthony's tweet.
Bitcoin miners have to sell their ETH.
And so when we look at the net coin, miners have to sell their ETH.
You asked me that when they when Bitcoin miners.
Yeah. Excuse me.
Sorry. When Bitcoin miners mine Bitcoin, yes, they have to sell the Bitcoin
to pay for the expenses because it's very competitive, very low margins.
And so when when the sailor was accumulating
like three times more than the Bitcoin mining sell pressure,
there was bullish Bitcoin because like, oh, like all the supply is being
soaked up by the by like Michael Saylor and Bitcoin treasuries.
Anthony is doing that same thing of alluding to that same effect.
And it's just even more like there's even larger discrepancy here
between the seven hundred and twenty million dollars that was purchased
versus the six point seven million dollars of ETH that was minted.
But the thing is, are you sticking ETH right?
I'm sticking ETH.
Did you do well?
Do you do you sell the ETH rewards that you accrue?
It depends. I mean, mostly, mostly not because I continue to be bullish
at these prices. Yeah.
And so you just you just stake that ETH too, right?
That's what most ETH stakers do.
They stake their ETH and then sometimes less their tax bills.
But yes, whatever. Yeah.
You pay for those in other ways.
You take when you stake ETH stakers, when they stake, they take their ETH
rewards and they stake them again.
They keep on accumulating the stake because they don't have very much costs.
So you don't have to sell. Right.
And so like the there's not even any sell pressure there.
It's actually just accumulation.
There's just accumulation going on.
Yes. And the story behind the last bull market, again,
we're we talk about put this in perspective, right?
We're not even at ETH all time highs.
We're not even at December all time highs.
December, we are still 40 percent off of all time highs.
Yeah. OK. So like at some level, this is a pump for ants still. OK.
This for like, you know, you still have a lot more to go.
I mean, 2021 was crazy.
Do you remember all of that?
Twenty twenty, twenty twenty one.
We were range bound from like one hundred and fifty to three hundred
for a very long time and then explosion.
I went to four thousand one hundred dollars.
People don't remember that air of what you can actually do.
But at that time, what was really interesting is the ETH
monetary schedule kind of sucked where issuance was like what?
Like five percent or something. This is pre merge. Yeah.
It was like three ETH per block in a proof of work context.
Yeah, it wasn't great.
Yeah, it wasn't great.
This time around, you have much less supply.
Annual issuance is like point four or five percent.
We have not seen ETH in a bull market under the paradigm
of both proof of stake and EIP one five five nine, which came in twenty
twenty three and twenty twenty four, twenty twenty two and twenty
twenty three, respectively.
See. And so, yeah.
The other thing I saw this week, which was interesting,
there were actually days where Bitcoin was down,
but down was down in dollars and ETH was up in dollars on the 24 hour.
And again, this is this is segments of time.
But I just like do you remember the last time we've seen this?
That has not happened in a long time.
Sometimes you've had days.
Sometimes you've had days where ETH outperforms Bitcoin, right?
Those have been rare.
But I can't even remember a day this cycle where Bitcoin's
actually gone down and ETH has gone up.
So this is some more story of the winds changing here.
We got more to talk about ETH in the in the Treasury section.
We're not done talking about ETH.
But do you want to talk about macro really fast, though?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You want to know what happened here in the macro world?
Yeah, in macro world, in the world.
Can you start with is it bullish or bearish?
Oh, actually, before we get to that, can we just check in on coin?
Oh, yeah. Total crypto market cap, because I feel like we might be all time highs.
We are tied for all time highs on the market.
We are three point nine trillion dollars.
We hit three point nine trillion dollars four months ago, five months ago.
So we are tied for a total crypto market cap.
And that is inclusive of Bitcoin dominance being very high.
Yeah. Yeah.
Good stuff. Good stuff.
All right. Here's what's going on in macro.
So we had some CPI numbers in the report.
Inflation picked up a little bit, but like it really wasn't that bad.
It just ticked up a little bit.
But it was pretty much as expected.
And I think the big story here.
Oh, I should say the numbers 12 12 month was at two point seven percent.
This is still the highest since February, but pretty much in line with expectations.
Do you know the story that was going on like three or four months ago
about tariffs causing inflation?
We just haven't really seen that in the data yet.
In fact, if you look at Polymarket compared to that point in time
where you had U.S. recession odds in 2025 at about 64 percent
during a tariff craziness, it's down to about 20 percent.
Now, of course, we have less time in the year.
So the prediction gets, you know, like a little a little more crisp, but 20 percent.
So recession fears have kind of evaporated from the market pretty much.
And Trump, of course, used this as an opportunity to to to be Powell over the head.
He said consumer prices low.
Bring Fed bring down the Fed right now.
He's talking to Powell, of course, about this.
And I don't know if you saw this, David, but there was actually
the New York Times reported that President Trump actually drafted a letter
to fire Chair Powell.
All right. So he had the letter all drafted.
I've got to wonder what that letter said.
But he had the letter.
This is what the New York Times was extremely cordial and reported.
OK, but then reporters asked Trump, do you have the letter?
Have you drafted a letter?
They say Trump said, I haven't drafted a letter.
Reporter said, I have concepts of a letter.
The reporter goes, so you didn't show it to Republican lawmakers last night.
This is what the New York Times is reporting.
I talked about the concept of firing Powell.
No, no, no.
He actually said the word concept.
Yeah, this is a quote.
Did it again.
Reveal it.
The guy's a fucking meme lord.
It's great. It's great.
So Trump on Jerome Powell, he said he's a terrible Fed chair.
I was surprised he was appointed, apparently forgetting to remember
that he was the guy that originally appointed Powell, actually.
So it's all, you know, great stuff.
But what a circus.
It is a circus.
I mean, lots of clippable stuff you can talk about on the week.
But the bottom line for me is like, what's the probability
that Jerome Powell is out as the Fed chair?
Again, this would be unprecedented.
Never happened in U.S. history. Right.
Polymarket gives that an odds of about 20, 21 percent chance happening this year.
OK, so still pretty low odds. Pretty low odds.
Can I get my macro take? Yeah.
I don't want to rock the boat.
I think if you are just like,
irrationally or uber bullish, you want Trump to fire
the Powell so that he can like lower down interest rates.
Do you think you want that?
I don't know if you want that. I think that I think that's naive.
I think some like naive bulls are like, yeah, just cut the interest rates.
Fire Powell cuts the interest rates.
Let's fucking take this to the moon, which will probably happen.
And then there will be a massive hangover all throughout 2022.
And it's going to just delay further wealth.
Like it's short term wealth. It's short term.
I don't even know if it's like who knows how the market might react to that.
They might react in the opposite way.
They might be like, OK, the central bank impartiality is totally screwed.
The US is going down.
I think that's a black swan.
I think we don't want to rock the boat.
We have a good thing going right now.
The SPY, the S&P 500 is up two and a half percent
from its peak in January right before the tariff dip.
So if you just ignore the tariffs, we are we're at all time highs right now.
Like things are good.
Like, let's just not keep it going.
I mean, I don't change anything.
I'm kind of inclined to agree with Polymarket that I don't think it's going to happen.
It's like 20 percent.
But the odds that Trump continues to talk shit about your own power,
what are the odds of that?
Yeah, what are the odds of that?
I don't I don't want power that I was doing fine.
Give that 100 percent odds.
OK, coming up next, David, we got to talk about this race to a billion dollars
in each treasury.
Seems like all of these treasuries are racing.
And we may have a winner already on the week.
Somebody first to a billion in need.
Also, we've got more billion dollars of these billion dollars of it.
Not when I need to specify about that, because we're going to talk about that later.
More more Bitcoin mining companies.
They're pivoting to each treasuries.
And also Peter Thiel is making a big bet.
Peter Thiel has entered the chat.
Yeah. And you got to tell me more about the the Coinbase wallet
turning into a super app and everything app.
They've got a big revamp.
We'll have some videos and more.

Okay, we got maybe the first to $1 billion worth of ETH in treasuries.
It's been a race and I gotta say,
the race may have concluded earlier than I thought.
It's moving faster.
We've got number one, this is a strategic ETH reserve, by the way.
I'm gonna filter by treasury companies here.
We got a new number one and it's just over $1 billion worth of ETH.
That's $300,000.
This is Bitmine Immersion Technologies.
Okay, this is Tom Lee's.
Tom Lee, this is Team Tom Lee.
This is the horse that Tom Lee is the jockey of.
He's riding, yeah, he's riding this Bitmine Immersion Technology horse.
He's in the lead.
But he just like, he just took the lead, okay?
Kind of last minute.
It looked like Sharp Link Gaming was going to be first.
Joe Lubin, Joe Lubin's the jockey of Sharp Link Gaming.
Yup, that's SBET.
We'll talk maybe more about these tickers.
Maybe people will remember, maybe they'll forget like I do,
almost on a weekly basis, we get so many tickers going on.
But Lubin with SBET, he got up to $960 million,
at least publicly disclosed.
He may have more that's not yet been publicly disclosed, but will be.
So just short of a billion.
So David, Tom Lee may have won the first round here
to a $1 billion worth of ETH.
I think that's great for him, $1 billion of ETH,
but he's at 300,000 Ether-ish,
and Joe Lubin's at 280,000 Ether.
The better number is who's first to 1 million Ether.
Oh, okay, okay, but...
I think that's a much better race,
because it's roughly three times more than what we need,
where we're at right now, and it's ETH-denominated.
And so the ETH price doesn't actually...
Because then we're measuring dollars of ETH price,
and then we just... Why denominate in dollars?
It's millions of ETH on the balance sheet is what we want.
Okay, Tom's thinking the same thing, David.
He's already ahead of that line of thought, okay?
This is a quote from Tom Lee about Bitmine.
We are well on our way to achieving our goal of acquiring and staking
5% of overall ETH supply.
David, Tom Lee wants to buy 5% of total ETH supply.
What are we talking about? What's the math on that?
If you want to do ETH-denominated,
what's ETH-denominated 5% of total supply?
We're at 120 million,
so times .05 is...
Six. Six million ETH.
Tom Lee wants six million ETH.
He's got 300,000 now.
He's got 300,000. He wants to get to six million.
He's basically at zero.
He basically doesn't have any ETH.
That is what...
That is probably one Michael Saylor worth of ETH supply
if you do the comp to Bitcoin, right?
What does Saylor have? Three? Four percent?
No, yes. Maybe he has three percent.
Maybe it's 2.5. He's trying to do a 2X Saylor.
All right, I've got the number.
It's 2.86% is Michael Saylor.
This is Michael's strategy, or strategy, I should say.
Michael's strategy, Michael Saylor.
Strategy owns 2.86% of the total Bitcoin supply.
All right.
So Tom Lee wants six percent,
and Joseph Lewin wants to beat him there.
He said five percent.
Five percent.
He says five percent.
Yeah, yeah.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Yes.
It's actually interesting.
SBET actually has more ETH now, publicly,
than the Ethereum Foundation.
Okay, so that was...
So the Ethereum Foundation made a sale of ETH this week
to do their normal funding operations,
but they just sold it to MicroStrategy.
Or excuse me, to SBET, to Joe Lewin.
So it never actually hit the order books.
Yeah.
And everyone was very bullish about that.
It's like, oh, the ETH's not gonna dump on us.
They can just buy it.
Those are gonna get absorbed by SBET.
But like also at the same time,
it's just neutral because then the SBET dollars
don't actually hit the order books.
This news came in, I don't know if this is recent,
but it just came in with the Edgar filings.
I can't believe I'm talking about Edgar filings, okay?
This is where...
One of us has to do it.
Peter Thiel bought 9% of Tom Lee's ETH treasury company.
That's the bit mine.
Okay, so Peter Thiel is in on all of this too.
He's providing some of the capital
for, I guess, these ETH purchases.
That seems kind of bullish to me,
of big money, institutional money,
coming into these ETH treasury products.
The thing is too, there's more coming, okay?
So it's not just these companies.
There's other horses that are going to enter this race.
Pretty certain of that.
Maybe let's look at the stock prices here.
These are the ETH treasury companies
that are all publicly traded in the US.
So the first is SBET.
So this is Sharp Link.
Look at this chart.
That is an unreal chart.
That is a chart that just is a parabola up
starting at the very beginning of July.
Okay, but before that, do you remember that?
Do you remember this bump right here?
That weird spike where it was announced
and it had already pumped from a dollar up to $50
and then it crashed back down
and then everyone on Twitter was gravedancing on it.
That was such a weird, what happened there?
What happened?
It looked like such a low float thing to do
and then it seems like just a bunch more float
has hit the market.
The market's behaving much more orderly right now.
It is, but this was literally, I think,
crypto investors misinterpreting the Edgar filings,
the SEC filings.
They thought all the original holders of this
were exit selling and they misinterpreted it.
Yeah, people were wrong.
Not fully recovered, but it's back to 34.
Actually-
I don't think there was much volume.
Sorry, go back there and look at the volume
under the very big spike that happened in June.
Oh yeah.
Just no volume, absolutely no volume.
Good point.
And so people are like,
oh, Joseph Lubin and ETH people are dumping on you.
It's like it hit $100 for a blip
because people were FOMO, we were trying to snipe it.
Now the volumes under it are 10 times larger
than when it was at like $100.
Okay, this is Bitmine.
So this is the BMNR.
This is the Tom Lee.
I can't believe we're looking at stocks so much on this, okay.
It's stonk season, man.
Okay, so I don't know what this chart is showing you.
I don't really know.
It looks like that one mountain in the Midwest
I'd like to climb.
This is Bitdigital, another mountain maybe
you want to climb here because it's going up.
It's a nice ascend here from-
I mean, Espet has all the price action.
All of these are just not really doing what Espet is doing.
Yeah, and then there's BT.
This one's nice, BTCS.
Yes.
These are what I'm quoting are the top four.
And if you're noticing all the Bs in these ticker symbols,
it's because it used to be Bitcoin mining companies.
Yeah, these are all Bitcoin miners,
which is kind of interesting that Bitcoin miners are like,
you know what, mining sucks.
We're going to accumulate ETH.
Literally, I mean, this is the founder of Bitdigital
we have an episode coming out with the founder of Bitdigital
and he basically said it was a shit.
He said it was a shit business.
And so instead they've diversified into staking ETH,
which is also validating a chain.
There's another company that just this morning,
another Bitcoin company pivoting to ETH.
This is BTC Digital.
This is something we hadn't talked about yet.
This is BTCT.
You got a third V acronym here.
I wonder how far this is, the brand of this is indicative.
Like does Wall Street see notice
like all of these are Bitcoin mining companies
becoming ETH treasury companies.
And do they take that into account
as to like what's going on?
Cause like my narrative here as a crypto native
who's familiar with these subjects is like, oh yes,
this is highly indicative
of Bitcoin's long-term security problems.
And you're actually seeing Bitcoin miners being like,
okay, well, we are not paid much by Bitcoin.
We're not paid enough to keep on doing what we're doing.
So let's do something else.
And all of a sudden,
when something good lands on their doorstep,
they immediately jump ship to that other good thing,
which is ETH, which has a sustainable.
I mean, I don't know.
They don't really have to do that.
The CapEx expenditure of ASIC mining
and like electricity and all that stuff,
they're just doing the ETH.
Well, the CapEx is buying ETH.
That's CapEx is buying ETH, but like, yeah, right.
But that doesn't deteriorate like the electricity
and the actual hardware that they would have to buy.
So it's a better business.
And to me, that is indicative
of the security budget stuff story
that we've told for years.
I think that's a longer term story.
I think probably Wall Street is not looking at that right now.
I think right now they're just looking at,
oh my God, could this be the next Bitcoin?
Question mark, right?
And they're very excited about that.
And it looks like it's a treasury asset
from early indications.
One other thing that the strategic ETH reserve
actually added was the price to the MNAV.
A very geometric.
Yeah, this is the premium above basically the assets,
the ETH assets under these companies.
Well, higher is more of a premium.
Higher is more expensive.
Like, I don't know necessarily if it's better.
It depends on like, if you own it, it's better.
If you're a buyer though.
If you are, yeah, it's not great for the buyers.
If you already own it, it's better
because that means that's the premium that you're getting.
For ETH holders, you want to see higher.
Higher means that there's more premium to squeeze
to buy more ETH.
So the premium eventually turns into buy pressure for ETH.
Yeah, I think that's true.
Also, I think it's indicative of froth
potentially in the future, right?
There's a time where these premiums will go down.
There's a time when the premiums will be under one,
but when they're above one, we're happy.
Anyway, so we got a range, you know, SBET is 2.63 MNAV,
whereas Tom Lee is 2.19 MNAV.
Anyway, investors can look at this
and all the data is on the strategic ETH reserve.
So, wow, that's the treasury story
and it seemed to come out of nowhere.
David, there's also another treasury on the scene this week.
I don't know if you saw this.
The Hype Token getting its own treasury,
Sonnet Biotherapeutics.
I believe this is its second treasury reserve company,
Hype's second treasury reserve company,
which is pretty crazy.
This new company will hold 12.6 million Hype tokens
at $570 billion.
They also have $305 million of cash,
which they are going to use to buy Hype.
And then also the investors in this,
you will hear and recognize their names,
Paradigm, Galaxy Digital, Pantera, Republic Digital.
Paradigm co-founder, Matt Hwang said,
we've been investors in Hyperliquid since November 2024.
We keep hearing from our Tradify friends
that they'd like easier access.
So I'm pretty sure Paradigm just like had their Hype bags
and then they did the in-kind investment
into this new vehicle.
And then they were able to get shares back.
And so now they have the shares
and we're like, why do you want those?
Well, cause they traded a premium.
Yeah. It's a free premium.
That's the thing is as excited as I am
about all of these treasury entities,
particularly for ETH and kind of the propagation
of ETH as a reserve asset,
treasury reserve asset first, right?
You can also start to see the signs
of how this gets too bubbly and too frothy
and almost how it ends, right?
So some of these are funded by,
this goes for all treasuries,
in-kind contributions, as you said.
So somebody already has a bag, let's say,
of ether or Bitcoin or Hype,
and they just contribute it to this entity
before it goes public, essentially.
And then they get an MNAV premium, okay?
And then they can, quote unquote, exit to retail, all right?
I'm not saying that's what's happening yet,
but you start to, always in the beginnings
of these big narrative, like exciting bubble type things,
you can sort of, if you squint hard enough,
you can see how it's also going to end.
So be excited now.
And also at some point in time,
probably it's gonna get overheated and buyer beware.
I don't think we're close to that yet,
but you can see a little bit.
I don't know if it's necessarily retail.
It's squeezing the juice out of public markets,
out of the TradFi markets, retail included,
but also large investors, right?
Like whoever's buying in their brokerage,
it's that's who is paying for the premium,
and that's what the premium converts
into buying the L1 asset.
Let's talk about another exciting retail product
that Coinbase just rolled out.
This is the base app.
So I believe this used to be, David,
correct me if I'm wrong,
this used to be the Coinbase wallet,
and they've rebranded this.
Toshi.
Toshi turned into Coinbase wallet.
Yeah, it used to be called the Toshi wallet.
Oh, that's a long time ago.
I remember that.
Which was Brian Armstrong's like cat or something or dog.
Okay, so that was a long time ago.
I don't think most people even remember.
Congrats if you remember what Toshi was,
but then Coinbase wallet,
now it's the base app basically.
The base app.
But it's totally revamped.
So they've added a bunch of things.
What have they added here?
It's just that Coinbase and Base and Jesse
really leaning into on-chain social.
So they're just continuing to double, triple down
on the whole on-chain social thing.
So it is a Farcaster client.
So when you go on there, it's Farcaster.
It's their own client.
So they're a competitor to Warpcast.
And so you can do tweets and all the things
that Warpcast, Farcaster allows you to do.
You can buy-
They're using the Farcaster protocol,
importantly, yes? Exactly, exactly.
Yeah, and so you can tweet
and you can share out tokens that you buy
and do any of the other features that Farcaster has.
Zora Markets, for example.
There's like ENS.
And then there's also Payments.
And then they're doing the whole mini-app thing.
So there is an open graph for mini-apps as well.
They brand it as an everything app.
It's a super app, is what Brian Armstrong called it.
And so it does a bunch of different things.
There's also an encrypted chat.
And then you can just like trade tokens
and like I said, make payments.
And so kind of encroaching on world apps territory
because they're doing the mini-apps too.
Telegram, the Tom blockchain also doing mini-apps.
So mini-apps are a thing.
Now the base app is also doing this.
And then, yeah, like emphasis on really leaning
into the creator economy.
They had a Gary Vee and People Pleaser
and one other creator that wasn't familiar
who talked about how NFTs and the creator economy
just helped them with their careers.
So they were kind of doing like a narrative campaign
for the creator economy and like branded it with the base app.
So yeah, pretty cool presentation.
Well, all the posts can be minted, right?
To your point about the creator.
So they've also integrated Zora.
What I think is interesting here is it just feels
like it's a coming together of a whole bunch of narratives
from like circa 2015, 2016 for Ethereum.
So you got money, okay?
That's obviously stable coins.
That's ether the asset.
You have identity.
So they've integrated E and S in this thing.
So you have one single identity.
You also have socials.
So this is the Farcaster platform.
That's a little web three E.
And then you also have the ability to create mint posts.
That's the creator economy stuff.
You have markets.
So you got Uniswap in here, very easy to trade things.
You've got all of the DEXs in here.
And they've got the communication protocol XMTP,
which is decentralized permissionless communication.
And they slapped it all together
in a nice polished retail friendly, user friendly front end.
So this is like, this almost feels like the contours
of crypto's version of a super app, of an everything app.
I haven't used this yet.
So I'm looking at videos at this point in time,
but I could see some potential here.
I could see it all coming together.
Yeah, it is definitely like a dream come true
from very early narratives up to like 2021, 2022
on-chain social, like you said.
I was listening to this presentation and I was like,
I don't think this app is for me.
Like I'm still yet to become a post collector
or things of that nature.
And I feel like this is kind of like a shared sentiment.
Like I want Coinbase to do this and to win
and to make this a reality and to take
on-chain social mainstream and to have
collecting content and the creator economy.
I want that to work.
It doesn't work for me.
And I don't think my peers-
When's the last time you've been on a Farcaster?
Has it been a long time?
Well, I was perusing through this app yesterday,
not on my phone, but on a friend's phone
who had the access to it.
It's like Farcasters kind of putting it together.
I go on Farcaster and I enjoy it.
I also feel like it's somewhat overwhelming
with all of kind of the mini app experience,
but it's evolving very fast.
I don't know.
I mean, I think it might be for you, David.
Maybe not yet, but-
The creator economy and coining content and I don't-
You don't want to coin your post?
Look at this post.
This is a perfect kind of post to coin.
This is Brian Armstrong and Jesse from Baze.
Jesse Pollock from Baze doing a little
a fist bump handshake kind of exchange here.
That was a nice moment.
And I think they are going to coin that
on the Coinbase Baze app.
So there you go.
I'm not totally, I'm supportive of Jesse
and I want him to win.
I have not been coining content, pilled.
You haven't been, you coined any content yet?
I have not.
No, I have not.
What do we got coming up, man?

It was crypto week in D.C.
That's what Trump declared it.
This is Bo Hein.
So he's an executive director
in the President's Council of Advisors,
basically for crypto.
He said, huge week ahead.
It's crypto week in the house.
Genius heads to the president's desk.
That's his genius bill.
Clarity, another bill, moves to the Senate.
Time to make America the crypto capital of the world.
Donald Trump echoed those sentiments.
You know what?
We should start with the genius bill itself, of course.
You guys know we've talked about this for a long time.
That is the landmark stablecoin bill
that passed in the Senate with a decent majority,
even got some Democrat support,
and is now in the House, okay?
By the time that you are listening to this,
I am predicting,
I think you are probably predicting, David,
that that will have passed.
So assuming that's true,
we have the first stablecoin act,
the first largest legislative action
out of Congress for crypto ever,
and it's a milestone moment.
I do think Scott Besson is right.
The passage of this bill,
we're going to see trillions in stablecoins on chain, okay?
Scott Besson echoed sentiments of three trillion by 2030.
So that in and of itself is significant.
There was last minute, some jockeying around.
They tried to package all of these bills together.
There were actually three bills.
There was the genius bill.
There was the Clarity Act as well.
That's defining what the difference between a commodity
and a security with respect to crypto is.
And then there was like an anti-Central Bank
digital currency bill of some sort.
And some people wanted to package
all of these things together.
And so it was difficult to get all of the Republicans
on board last minute.
So Trump tried to knock some heads together
in his own party and get some of those
that were not voting yes to actually vote yes.
So that's probably happened right now,
which means huge progress for crypto in the US.
So while this was going on,
there was also a campaign by some Democrats.
This is Representative Maxine Waters.
She actually announced an Anti-Crypto Corruption Week.
And she said, I'm sounding the alarm in MSNBC
short and op-ed about this.
GOP crypto bills don't just fail to protect consumers.
They green light Trump's billion dollar crypto grift
and invite the next financial crisis.
I think I'm kind of with her on the first part.
There's a little bit of a grift going on.
I don't know about the second part.
And I want to play this clip for you, David.
This is Elizabeth Warren on the genius act
in some of these bills.
Guardrails to make sure that crypto
isn't used to blow up our entire economy.
So I'm very worried about that,
but I want to add one more twist.
And that is the clarity bill has all those problems,
but it also has a provision in it
that would let any company listed
on the New York Stock Exchange opt out of SEC regulation
by just digitizing themselves,
put themselves on the blockchain,
and all of a sudden it turns out that Amazon or Meta
or General Motors is no longer governed by the SEC.
You can just put yourself on the blockchain
and then all the rules just go away.
That's how it works.
You can just digitize yourself.
Do you hear what she said?
That could literally blow up the value
of the New York Stock Exchange.
All right, we still have some holdouts.
That's why I'm in crypto because I understand
if I'm just on the blockchain, then no rules apply to me.
That's what I'm here for.
He's being sarcastic, okay, in case this gets clipped.
You just digitize yourself,
but you put yourself on the blockchain
and then you get to be God.
I'm just kind of annoyed at the doubling down
on a clearly losing position.
Talk about the anti-corruption, that's fine,
but to talk about crypto as if it's going to blow up
U.S. capital markets, that is just crazy at this point.
Yeah, before crypto,
before Elizabeth Warren came after crypto,
my family was very pro Elizabeth Warren
and I'm like, oh, okay, sure.
She's like anti-big banks.
I'm like kind of into that.
And then when she goes on crypto, I'm like,
oh, wait, you're just lying about stuff.
Yeah, none of that's true.
None of that's true.
And now I can't trust anything that you say ever.
And now whenever my family is talking about Elizabeth Warren,
I'm like, bro, she's a snake.
Why are you guys supporting her?
Yeah, it's pretty disappointing, I think,
to some that are watching this.
David, tell me about the pump ICO,
because I don't think disappointing
is the word we would use for that.
Actually, some people are disappointed about that.
Oh, really?
Yeah, it started.
I wasn't paying attention.
Yeah, and this is why I'm doing this section.
Okay.
It started off pretty good and we are now down a decent bit.
So we are coming in at a $2 billion market cap.
Ooh, wow, wait, really?
Is it down that much?
Okay, wait a second.
No, no, no, no.
Market cap, $5.6 billion fully diluted.
Okay, so they're doing fine.
They're doing fine.
Okay, well, why are people...
The way I saw this was basically they had an ICO on chain.
It was a successful ICO.
It was filled in, I don't know,
six minutes or something like this?
12 minutes. You tell me.
12 minutes, okay.
And a chain didn't go down.
Some of this activity happened on exchanges.
Some of this happened on Solana.
There is some sort of a rev share components,
not 100%, but 25%.
Yeah, so they announced,
they started doing their initial buybacks
and then the token pumped up to its
now current all-time highs,
which, I mean, the token's actually not volatile.
I remember talking about how it's gonna be volatile.
Sorry, I was actually wrong about that.
The token price is very liquid
and it's pretty stable in the grand scheme of things.
Okay, so why are people mad?
Who's mad?
Well, because it went down.
It went down 10% while ETH went up 20%.
Okay.
And so it didn't try.
I don't think you actually tracked beta.
If you did the ICO, I think you're okay,
but since launch, it hasn't done anything.
So I think people's expectations are dashed.
Just to put out some stats,
this makes Pump the third largest ICO in history,
raised $600 million.
EOS is number one.
No one's ever gonna beat that.
$4.1 billion in 2017.
That was also crime.
Telegram did $1.7 billion in 2019
and now Pump is now number three at $600 million.
I mean, there's a lot more stats here.
Overall, I think it's successful
and the buyback is pretty cool
and we could see more of that,
but I think people were having higher expectations
than what happened.
I do have some breaking news, Ryan,
stuff that's not in the agenda.
So we're actually gonna go back into Ethereum conversation
because BlackRock's iShares,
ETH Treasury just filed for ETH staking.
Wow.
So they have filed to have ETH staking in the ETH ETF.
The ETH A, the BlackRock iShares for the ETH ETF
filed for staking.
And BlackRock gets what it wants.
That's not gonna help the ETH-Pump ratio there, David.
So, you know, I guess.
You have the ETH-Pump ratio.
Yes.
Are you looking at the ETH-Pump ratio?
No, dude.
You made reference to it.
I'm trying to riff off something you did.
Also, Binance doing a, what is this?
Yeah, Binance is doing launchpad.
Okay, actually, maybe perhaps one of the reasons
why Pump hasn't had the sellout performance
is this other launchpad called Bonk
continues to maintain volumes against Pump.
And so it's taking a little bit of the wind
out of the sales of Pump.
And then also, Binance has unveiled its own launchpad
on BNB chain, 4.meme, remember 4?
4.meme is now the Pump fund of BNB.
And so that's out there.
And then, Ryan, I'm gonna read you a headline
and you're gonna guess what year it's from.
Snoop Dogg sells $12 million of NFTs in 30 minutes.
What year is this headline from?
Yeah, I mean, I know it's now.
That just happened this week.
But if I were to hear that in isolation,
that would be so, you know, 2021 coded.
That's what was happening all of the time.
So this was on the Tonne blockchain
and this is part of the sticker pack.
So the stickers you can use in Telegram
can be like unique, fungible assets,
non-fungible assets.
The tokens in the collection included vintage cars,
swag bags, a digital dog,
a marijuana-related objects, of course,
a mix of other items and symbols.
So it's a Telegram gift that people can purchase.
And because it was on Tonne,
it's integrated into Telegram.
Yeah, $12 million in 30 minutes by selling stickers,
NFT stickers on Telegram.
I'm not feeling bullish on the JPEGs these days, David.
You know, it was-
You're not a buyer of a lit blunt, Ryan?
It's been a hard four years on the lit blunts JPEGs, OK?
I'm going to wait this one out.
I'm going to let other people go first.
David, this was actually big, OK?
This is Shane Copland.
Do you remember it was...
What is it? Just like November?
It was November of last year because it was just-
Right before the election? Yeah.
No, it was eight days after the election.
OK. After the election.
So Shane Copland, the founder of Polymarket,
the FBI just showed up at his apartment,
I believe he's in New York, busted in.
Without due process, without a warrant, busted in, arrested him
and took a whole bunch of his equipment.
Including his phone, yeah.
Including his phone.
This is the founder of Polymarket.
Obviously, we talk about Polymarket all the time.
Incredibly successful prediction market.
This is a startup founder in the US.
OK, an update on that story.
This is from Shane.
Eight months ago on election night,
we were on top of the world after Polymarket called the election.
You remember that?
Eight days later, the FBI broke down my door at 6 a.m.
and took all of my computers and phones,
looking for anything that could imply foul play.
While traumatic, it etched the story of Polymarket's accuracy
and enduring resistance into the history of American politics.
And today, here's the news part.
I'm happy to announce that this the chapter of the story is over.
After cooperating and engaging, we've been cleared of any wrongdoing.
Justice prevailed.
OK, so the FBI was like, oops, sorry, you didn't actually do anything.
But what kind of evidence did they have busting into his house
at 6 a.m. in the morning and confiscating all of his stuff?
Is that not crazy to you?
And let me ask you this.
Do you think that the outcome of this investigation
would have been different under a different president?
I don't know. I don't know how to think about that.
I don't want to think about that.
It doesn't make me feel good to think about that.
I do enjoy the juxtaposition of an application that speaks truth to power,
gets harassed by the FBI, and then they just have to
the FBI just has to let him go and be like, you did nothing wrong.
But like this this technology that's anti authoritarian gets authoritarian.
Like the eye of Saron gets pointed straight at Shane Copeland.
And then because at least we're in a good country with a good court system,
Shane gets through that process as just completely got clear.
Brian Armstrong says this was one of the most egregious examples of lawfare
from the last administration that should never have been possible in America.
Imagine having your door broken down for predicting an election.
The onus was on the government to prove to prove there was something worth
pursuing here and they failed to do that.
This is how you lose trust in institutions.
All right. So that's good news, though.
He was exonerated. Shane Copeland.
We've got another trial that started this week.
This is the trial of Roman Storm, the tornado cash trial.
And as you'll recall, Roman Storm faces charges of a conspiracy
to commit money laundering, conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions,
conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business
at a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison.
Forty five years, David.
The stakes are incredibly high.
Roman Storm raised a whole bunch of funds from the crypto community.
He still needs more, I believe, because this trial is going
even longer than everyone suspected.
There is a judge in the case, Catherine Polka-Filela.
She is not exactly crypto favorable, OK, not exactly.
It seems like favorable to Roman Storm's case.
Of course, we don't know for sure, but this has been indicated
from some of the pre-trial statements and some of the things
she allowed in the trial and things she didn't.
So the prosecution, this is the government in this case, is alleging
and trying to prove that Roman Storm turned a blind eye or he enabled
some of the criminal activity that happened on tornado cash.
Whereas the defense is, of course, saying, no, this is a decentralized,
open protocol.
Roman Storm had no ability, no control over how third parties would actually use it.
This is similar to, you know, HTTPS, the Internet, cryptography.
Criminals, good guys can use it.
It's a tool. Bad guys can use it as well.
And this case is ongoing.
So like Ryan said, this case, this court case has just started.
So we're going to be continuing to watch this and we'll provide updates
part towards the end of every weekly rollout moving forward
just to keep an eye on this.
I don't feel like anyone really knows what the outcome here is,
which is kind of the scary thing.
The fact that this is like close at all to Roman Storm losing
is automatically scary.
It definitely definitely doesn't deserve to have anything happen to him.
And so it's something that we're going to be keeping an eye on moving forward
over the next four weeks, I think, is how long this case is expected to take.
So we wish the best for Roman Storm and we'll provide more updates as they come.
Guys, you got to end with this, of course, you know,
even though it's been bullish on the week.
None of this has been financial advice.
Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west.
This is the frontier. It's not for everyone,
but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
