NFTs are clearly one of the hottest topics in crypto at the moment. CryptoPunks,
Autoglyphs, Bored Apes, Pudgy Penguins, some of them selling for hundreds of thousands or even
millions of dollars. So are NFTs just a hype or a paradigm change? What are some of the most
interesting NFTs out there and what are the biggest challenges of this new space? You'll
find answers to these questions in this video. Before we begin, if you want to learn more about

place. An NFT or a non-fungible token is a way of representing ownership in the digital world. Since
the dawn of our civilization, humans have been collecting rare items from seashells and gems
to coins, post stamps and Pok√©mon cards. NFTs are just digital versions of that. Collectibles,
pieces of art, game items, domain names and even complex bespoke financial instruments,
all of these can be represented as NFTs. In contrast to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or
Ether, where each unit is interchangeable, NFTs are unique, at least in most cases.
The creator of an NFT project can decide on the exact parameters of their NFTs.
Some of the common examples are only one NFT per unique piece of art. Artists that create individual
pieces like people follow this approach. A collection where each item has a unique
combination of different traits, CryptoPunks, Bored Apes. A collection where there is a set
number of the same item in the collection, usually used for card collectibles like Mercurio cards.
The scarcity of individual NFTs can be verified on the blockchain where the project was created.
For example, we can tell with 100% certainty that there were only 10,000 original CryptoPunks
created on Ethereum. The authenticity of NFTs can also be instantly verified by checking
that the NFT we own was created using the original smart contract of a particular project.
The blockchain also provides a quick way of checking the provenance of each individual NFT,
which is basically the history of its ownership. If you'd like to dive a bit deeper into the
technical aspects of NFTs and learn, for example, what fungibility is or what different NFT standards
like ERC721 and ERC1155 are, you can check out my previous video about NFTs here.
Now let's go through some of the most popular NFT projects out there.
We couldn't start this with anything other than CryptoPunks. CryptoPunks,
very often called just Punks, are one of the oldest and one of the most significant NFTs.
The project that was pretty much forgotten about during the depth of the 2018-2019 bear market
resurfaced at the end of 2020 and took the world by storm. CryptoPunks, launched in June 2017 by
Larva Labs, a two-person team, was one of the first NFT projects presented as a collection of
similar items, where the uniqueness of each item was achieved by having a distinctive combination
of different traits, such as hats, sunglasses and hairstyles. Each Punk is a unique, algorithmically
generated 24x24 pixel art image. In 2021, it's crazy to think that CryptoPunks, now worth around
$350,000 for the cheapest one, were once claimable for free and users were able to mint them by
paying a few dollars for an Ethereum transaction. CryptoPunks initially started gaining popularity
within the crypto community itself, but this quickly expanded to the outside world, with famous
artists and celebrities joining the bandwagon. Jay-Z, Odell Beckham Jr., Steve Aoki, to name
just a few. In May 2021, a collection of nine Punks was sold at Christie's, one of the most
famous auction houses, for a whopping $16.9 million. Another prominent auction house, Sotheby's,
sold a rare Alien Punk for an astonishing $11.8 million in June. In August 2021, Visa announced a
purchase of a CryptoPunk as an addition to their collection focused on historically significant
items in commerce. This basically skyrocketed the floor price for a Punk, which is the lowest
amount that someone is willing to sell a Punk for, from around $100,000 to as much as $400,000.
CryptoPunks are clearly one of the most significant NFTs and are very often referred to
as the holy grail for any NFT collector. Punks also initiated another phenomenon, the PFP mania.
PFP, which stands for Profile Picture, is a type of NFT that is suitable for an online avatar.
Punk owners, including the previously mentioned celebrities, started using Punks as their profile
pictures on Twitter. This quickly led to the creation of new PFP-focused NFT projects,
as people who were already priced out of Punks started searching for something more affordable.
The launch of multiple PFP-focused projects ignited the PFP mania, with people changing
their profile pictures to NFTs on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, or even LinkedIn.
One of the earliest projects that benefited from the PFP phenomenon was Bored Apes Yacht Club,
often just called Bored Apes or B-A-Y-C. Bored Apes, created in April 2021 by Yugo Labs,
launched a 10,000-element NFT collection featuring high-resolution image art of apes
with different traits, from common apes with normal fur and beanies to extremely rare ones
with golden skin and crowns. Yacht Club in the name wasn't chosen by accident, as each NFT
from the collection acts like a membership card and grants access to member-only benefits,
one of them being a merch shop. Bored Apes, initially sold by Yugo Labs for 0.08 ETH,
are now trading in the range of 40 ETH for the cheapest ones. B-A-Y-C is a good example of a
project that created a strong community of NFT holders. Similarly to Cryptobanks, Bored Apes
will be featured in one of the upcoming Christie's and Sotheby's auctions. The PFP mania also resulted
in the creation of multiple other PFP NFT projects. Most of them were just low-effort clones
of one of the popular projects, but there were also exceptions. Some of them include
Cool Cat NFTs, featuring a collection of blue cats with different features, was created by an
artist, drawing the same blue cat for over 10 years. Pudgy Penguins also gained a lot of
traction and were even featured in the New York Times. Their main feature, they are super cute.
World of Women, a collection featuring unique, cool and diverse women,
was created with the aim of bringing more diversity and representation into the NFT space.
Besides completely new NFTs, the teams behind already successful projects can decide to launch
new collections, very often inspired by their original work. The two most prominent examples
are MiBits, released by the creators of Cryptobanks, and Mutant Apes, released by
the creators of Bored Apes. This approach allows for expanding the existing communities
and including people who might have been priced out of the original collections.
Although PFPs seem to be the main focus of the NFT community, let's not forget about other super
interesting niches within the NFT space, one of which is Generative Art. Generative Art lies at
the intersection of art and code. Artists, instead of drawing pieces of art by themselves,
write an algorithm that generates the art. The art is always generated at the time of
minting a new NFT and uses an input parameter, such as a transaction hash, that will be forever
associated with this particular token. This allows the users to feel like they are taking
part in the art creation, as two different users minting a piece of art from the same collection
would end up with different results. Autoglyphs are a prime example of Generative Art.
The collection of 512 items, also created by Larvalabs, was generated purely on chain.
This was possible as the art is created out of basic ASCII characters that can be displayed
as a result of executing the Autoglyphs smart contract itself. At the time of creation,
each Autoglyph had a different probability for drawing certain patterns, hence some pieces
are more rare than others. At the time of making this video, the cheapest Autoglyphs are listed for
475 ETH, which is worth around 1.8 million dollars. Other extremely popular pieces of Generative Art
come from Artblocks. The art featured on the Artblock platform is created using a script
written in a programming language called 5PJS. Each collection has its own script that is stored
on the Ethereum blockchain. A program written in 5PJS can generate different shapes with different
organizations, textures or colors, depending what the creator wants to achieve. Artblocks
curated is the most prestigious collection, with the most sold after pieces of Generative Art,
such as Ringer by Dimitri Shernyak and Fidenza by Tyler Hobbs. The most expensive Fidenza,
sold for 1,000 ETH, worth 3.3 million dollars at the time of purchase in August 2021.
Generative Art explores an interesting concept of artists becoming coders, or maybe coders becoming
artists. What happens if a generative algorithm could be created without any human help? Sounds
quite sci-fi for now, but I wouldn't be surprised if in the future the most expensive piece of art
was an NFT created by some kind of an AI. Besides PFPs and Generative Art, there are plenty of other
types of NFTs available. Artists can create NFTs for their individual pieces of art. A good example
is Beeple, who sold the most expensive NFT to date, representing 5,000 days of his work for 69
million dollars at Christie's in March 2021. Fun fact, if Beeple kept the 69 million dollars in ETH,
it would be worth over 140 million dollars now. Gaming is another area where NFTs have become
more and more important. Axie Infinity, Cryptokitties, and Avegochi are just a few good examples here,
and they probably deserve a whole separate video in the future. Metaverse is another big area with
huge potential. For example, the land sold on Decentraland is represented as NFTs. I also
wouldn't be surprised to see more and more popular PFPs being used as avatars in the Metaverse.
There are also a lot of non-PFP collections that have become really popular. One of them is Ether
Rocks, where NFTs of different rocks are being sold for millions of dollars. The main feature,
they were one of the first NFTs and there are only 100 of them. They were even recently featured in
one of the popular business TV programs. Besides pictures, NFTs can also represent short clips or
music. NBA Top Shots became extremely popular at the beginning of 2021 by selling clips of
the most viral moments in NBA. Euler Beats is a set of algorithmically generated music
stored on chain on Ethereum. Even tweets on Twitter could be sold as NFTs. The first tweet
ever by Jack Dorsey was sold in March 2021 for 2.9 million dollars. With new NFT projects launching
pretty much every day, we also have to remember about a few challenges of this still extremely
new space. To start with, not all NFTs are stored in the same way. One of the main features of NFTs
is their provable ownership, verifiability and provenance. As we know, this is achieved
by creating NFTs on decentralized blockchains such as Ethereum. But here comes a problem.
Although the beautiful high-resolution pictures of apes or penguins are cool, there is no way the
image files representing them can be stored on the blockchain itself. This leads to a situation
when most NFTs only include a link to the actual art and its metadata, which is then stored off
chain. There is a whole range of options when it comes to storing data off chain. Some projects
use centralized servers, others try to improve the situation by uploading their metadata and art to
IPFS. Other solutions, like Arwith, are also gaining traction. Generative art and certain
low-resolution NFTs are some of the exceptions here, as they can be entirely stored on chain.
Intellectual property rights are also another big issue. This is mostly as there are a lot
of inconsistencies between different projects. Some NFTs allow the owners to use them however
they want. Other projects limit the potential use of their NFTs and still assign the IP rights to
the creators. Ethereum gas fees can also certainly be a problem. Most NFT drops are launched in the
first-come first-served model. This attracts a lot of bot activities and can spike up gas prices
to crazy amounts, resulting in normal users either not getting into the sale or massively overpaying
for their mint. Other models, such as Dutch auctions notably used by art blocks, are also
being explored here. It will be interesting to see if NFTs get adopted on layer 2, as this could
certainly alleviate some of the gas pressures from Ethereum. Price discovery in an illiquid market,
such as the NFT market, can also be a problem. Fortunately, there are a lot of projects focusing
on tokenizing NFTs, which helps with improving liquidity and can be used for things like
discovering the floor price of certain collections. NFTX and fractional art are some of the popular
solutions here. Another major challenge is the infrastructure for buying, selling and displaying
NFTs. At the moment, most trading volume happens on OpenSea, where the curation of projects is
centralized. It would be amazing to see OpenSea decentralizing in the future and other more
decentralized solutions getting adopted over time. In the end, I believe that most of these
challenges will be solved sooner or later and they are just normal pain points of a completely new
and exciting industry. Besides Ethereum, which has become pretty much the standard for launching
NFTs, there are other layer 1s that allow for minting NFTs. Solana, Thesis and Polygon are
gaining some traction in this field. Another interesting development was the creation of
DAOs with the main purpose of buying NFTs. People who wouldn't be able to afford certain NFTs by
themselves can come together and form a DAO. Both NFTs can be later tokenized and distributed to
the members of the DAO. A good example here is PleaserDAO, that bought the original Dogecoin
NFT for 4 million dollars. It will also be interesting to see NFTs being used as marketing
tools. Projects will be able to airdrop their own NFTs or invite certain NFT owners to an
early release of their products. It's also amazing to see new things being tried in the NFT space,
one of which is the recent launch of Loot. Instead of creating an NFT with an image
described by certain metadata, Loot flipped the whole process upside down.
The Loot NFTs only contain the metadata that describes a set of items in a hypothetical
RPG game. It's up to the Loot community to decide how to use or even how to visualize these items.
It will be super interesting to see how far Loot can go in the future. There are pretty much no
boundaries on how far such an idea can be pushed, but the main challenge is to coordinate the
community over long-term goals instead of focusing on quick wins like unlimited airdrops.
With OpenSea volume hitting over 3 billion dollars in July, we are clearly in a very
interesting time for NFTs. Celebrities using Bored Apes as their profile pictures,
major business channels discussing EtherRocks, Visa buying CryptoPunks and new NFT funds popping
up. On the one hand, it feels like NFTs just got their mainstream attention. On the other hand,
the market, with hundreds of projects launching every week, may look a bit overheated.
In the end, it's worth noting that this is very common in a completely new space and resembles
a lot of periods of exponential growth in crypto. Personally, I think that whatever happens to the
market in the short to medium term doesn't really matter and NFTs are here to stay.
The quality projects will most likely appreciate in value over time.
The same cannot be said about thousands of copycat projects and low-quality cash grabs.
I believe that NFTs will completely revolutionize the internet. In the future,
most things we own in the digital world will be NFTs. Game items, collectibles,
cool pieces of art and even our metaverse gear. All of these have the potential to become NFTs.
