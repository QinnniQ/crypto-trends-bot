We're certainly seeing a lot of upheaval in world events today, and that is trending
people towards gold, and that's also turning people towards digital gold, which is Bitcoin.
You're seeing macro-wise countries around the world, major countries like Japan and
China have stopped buying U.S. treasuries, and there's traditionally been a lot of demand
for U.S. treasuries.
This leads the U.S. government to buy U.S. treasuries, buying its own printing, which
again leads people to look for currencies, sound money, as it were, that's not inflating,
that's not being printed.
We see both physical and digital gold demand just skyrocketing in both the U.S. and other
countries around the world.
All right, here we are with Jeff Garcic, the co-founder of Hemi, the biggest programmable
Bitcoin sidechain with almost a billion dollars in TVL.
Jeff, it's great to have you on the Defiant Podcast.
Thanks for having me.
Okay, so before we get into Hemi, Bitcoin DeFi, the things we'll talk about today, I'd
love to get more on your background because you're a true crypto OG going back to early
Bitcoin days, contributing to Bitcoin Core.
So, yeah, how did you go from there to here?
What was your process like and what led you to start Hemi?
Sure.
Well, allow me a little bit to go back a bit further in that I really queued up myself
to accept Bitcoin, find Bitcoin.
In the late 80s, I was on the internet before the internet was the web.
The web was invented in 1990, 1991, and I was already participating in this global village
that was decentralized, decentralization, the internet.
And I then spent 10 years under the toolage of the inventor of Linux, Linus Torvalds,
as one of the Linux lieutenants in the Linux kernel open source project.
And I really cut my teeth on what does it mean to be decentralized, what does it mean
to be open source, what does it mean to kind of put yourself and your software out there
for criticism, for review, and ultimately the goal is improving the software for everyone.
And all of that was kind of in preparation for, and I'll add one other facet as well,
I love science fiction and fantasy.
I love it.
And one of the book series that I read in the early 1990s, Shadowrun, kind of a futuristic
cyberpunk type universe, featured some characters using decentralized currency.
The characters in this fictional novel would transfer money by handing a small object like
a flash drive from one person to another.
This was called a cred stick, and you would pay for a job by handing someone a cred stick.
And that was, to me, the picture perfect example of decentralized currency.
So this picture, and my personal life, I just feel very blessed, very lucky to have queued
myself up for, in July 2010, I saw a post, Bitcoin, the decentralized currency, on slash.org,
news for nerds website.
And I immediately jumped in, I clicked, I downloaded the software.
Because it was open source, it's open to everyone's inspection.
And so crucially, Bitcoin was not about who was Satoshi, who was Satoshi's skill set,
what is Satoshi's resume look like.
It was all about the engineering.
And Satoshi's anonymity forced me and everyone else to look at the code, look at the engineering.
Don't look at the person, the person's not important, the system is important.
I looked at it, I was immediately skeptical.
I said to myself, surely there's just five servers in a data center somewhere.
And I proved myself wrong by looking at the code.
It was truly novel, truly decentralized, and something that I had never seen in computer
science before.
So like my Linux experience, I immediately started emailing patches to Satoshi.
And that's kind of the Linga Franca programmers, that's a patch is a software change.
And so you propose a change to software by emailing a patch to Satoshi.
My very first change, I proposed to Satoshi to raise the Bitcoin level from seven transactions
per second throughput to where I thought it needed to be 4,000 transactions per second.
And this, of course, this patch was totally broken, totally wrong.
And Satoshi pointed that out, but very courteously and provided that feedback.
That was my entree into Bitcoin, into decentralized currency, into decentralized programming.
And I'd say I owe a lot of it to Linus and to Satoshi for being great mentors, great
project leaders, really geniuses in their own right.
Wow.
What an intro.
I don't think I've had many people here say they emailed with Satoshi.
That's amazing.
Did any of your patches make it to the Bitcoin code?
Oh, absolutely.
Quite a bit.
I became the third most prolific Bitcoin developer.
There was Satoshi, then his number two, Gavin, and then myself as number three.
Wow, amazing.
And I guess your first patch to increase the Bitcoin block size, that relates pretty closely
to what you're doing now, like trying to scale Bitcoin.
That's exactly right.
So OK, from that time, in very early Bitcoin days, contributing to the Bitcoin code, how
was that timeline to actually building a Bitcoin scaling solution?
Well, it's 14 to 15 years, honestly.
There's been a lot of history, a lot of bubbles or generations of blockchain, but it feels
like today in 2025, the world's coming full circle, coming around to Bitcoin again.
It's in 2010, if we look at the accelerated timeline, 2010 was Bitcoin and then the first
generation of blockchains were photocopies of Bitcoin.
It's kind of the steam engine era of blockchain, where everyone had to have their own proof
of work network, their own data centers, very environmentally expensive, et cetera.
And then the second generation, you have Ethereum, the third generation kind of Solana, the fourth
generation, you kind of have the resurgence of DeFi.
And all of those generations, all of those histories, we've been searching for how to
scale Bitcoin, how to find the best Bitcoin sidechain solution.
And in 2010, an ironic prediction, I think, is coming true.
In 2010, we said in the very earliest days, the way to scale Bitcoin, the way to upgrade
Bitcoin, the way to improve Bitcoin, let the rest of the world develop solutions, test
those solutions in the real world, let them take the lumps, let them take the risks, and
then whatever survives, incorporate it into Bitcoin again.
So let everyone else kind of market test the solution and then take the best of the best
and incorporate that back into Bitcoin.
Now on a 15 year time scale, that's what we're doing, is we let the world road test Ethereum.
Ethereum is clearly a programmable layer.
We let the world road test DeFi.
DeFi is clearly composable primitives.
It makes sense, logical here to stay.
And now the time has come to apply that to Bitcoin.
And so that's where I think we come full circle through Bitcoin, EVM, DeFi.
And now we're combining it all back again into Bitcoin and obviously the project I'm
working on, Hemi.
And so what were the key lessons that you took from all this time that you're now applying
to Hemi?
Like, yeah, you said, you know, you're looking at what works and what doesn't.
So yeah, what are those things?
Sure.
One of the ways that Bitcoin sidechains are secured, well, let me back up a second.
And I'm pausing for editing.
One of the ways that I think scaling holistically occurs is kind of like, I use the analogy
of the champagne waterfall in hotels or weddings, is that the champagne comes down to that glass
in the center, but when it fills up, what does it do?
It spills over into the next level.
And that's literally what's happening with blockchain traffic today, is Bitcoin, Ethereum,
they can't hold all the payments for all the coffees in the world on layer one.
And if we even try to do that, the self-balancing nature of the network sends network fees high
because just like we're filming this in New York, just like New York congestion fees,
we have when it gets full, the fees go up.
And that's a good thing.
That's economics.
That's a self-balancing system.
When there's less congestion, the fees come back down.
And so it naturally balances, but that still means that the pipes are often full and expensive
and that leads to a bad user experience.
You're either paying two cents or $2 or $10 for a transaction, depending on time of day
and other random factors.
Well, what if there was a fast pass lane?
That's essentially what layer twos are, is you're going to build out the Bitcoin ecosystem.
You're going to be tied to the Bitcoin token and the Bitcoin economics, but Bitcoin script
and other technical detail is very limited.
And Bitcoin scaling, it just hits a scaling limit.
And so building out these layer two blockchains, these Bitcoin side chains, are that holistic
solution that we've been searching for for over a decade.
But it took the piece parts of Ethereum and the EVM.
It's very much like in the 1990s and 2000s, Java and the JVM.
Its compatibility, compatible standards were created in the EVM that fostered DeFi.
And now we can package that again, all into a single, all-encompassing solution for Bitcoin
DeFi.
So Hemi is an EVM compatible chain, right?
So from kind of the things that you did want to take from all this experimentation, is
Ethereum EVM as kind of a programmable layer for applications to be built on.
Now with so many side chains and Bitcoin layer twos coming to market and mainnet, there's
this discussion on what actually constitutes a Bitcoin layer two.
And it seems like what can make a Bitcoin layer two is whether it gets its security
the Bitcoin network or whether it does that from its own set of validators or nodes.
Where does Hemi stand in that difference?
Well, we believe that the best security comes from Bitcoin itself.
So Hemi inherits its security from Bitcoin.
We created something called proof of proof mining or POP, POP mining.
And this is a method of storing the proofs from the Hemi blocks into the Bitcoin blockchain,
which is our ultimate source of truth.
That is, we believe, we like to say Bitcoin and Ethereum, they're the king and queen of
crypto.
Bitcoin is the root of the crypto tree.
It's solid, it's secure, it's not going anywhere.
And Ethereum is kind of like the Grand Central Station of crypto, where if you're interchanging,
you're going to go through EVM.
If you're defying, you're going to go through EVM.
And the fusion of that is what enabled Hemi to realize that layer two need and kind of
outcome.
I think there are a number of Ethereum L2s.
There are over 100 at last count as we film this.
There are a number of Bitcoin L2s, over 100 at last count.
And I'd like to point out the macroeconomics and then back into your question.
The macroeconomics are such that it's very, very inexpensive, almost zero cost to create
a new blockchain.
And therefore, we'll have a large supply of blockchains heading into specific demand.
And you see the same thing with Ethereum L2s.
However, all of those are tiny teams photocopying technology.
They didn't build that themselves.
They're just forking an optimism, they're just forking an anchoring solution.
They don't have the depth of technology or the depth of team that Hemi does.
And we were examining this two years ago and saying, what is the best layer two solution
today?
What is the best layer two solution tomorrow if you're thinking 20 chess moves ahead?
And it's really got to be getting back to your question, something that builds on Bitcoin's
proof of work security as its base.
That's not going anywhere, again, as I mentioned, our thesis Bitcoin is the root of the crypto
tree.
And so we literally build with that philosophy in mind.
And so from a layer two perspective, getting a little bit technical, there are multiple
ways that you can secure in Bitcoin.
One of those is, and I'll dive into that, proof of proof mining or POP that we invented.
Another method is called merged mining.
And this is where the chain has to make an agreement with a number of Bitcoin miners,
essentially create a mining cartel in order to simply secure your chain.
And to us, that's the antithesis of decentralization.
You have to centralize to get your decentralized chain going.
It's just a starting problem or a non-starter.
And so what we chose, again, we invented proof of proof mining.
This uses normal censorship resistant Bitcoin transactions and stores proofs from the Hemi
chain into Bitcoin.
So we're entirely relying on Bitcoin confirmations for Hemi chain security at the outset.
We call that super finality.
When it's in the Hemi chain, it has finality.
And then the second step, when it's secured with six confirmations in the Bitcoin L1 chain,
that's super finality.
And that is the highest level of security that we could attach to a Hemi transaction.
So that means that if Hemi is censored or misbehaves or something happens, then Hemi
users could ultimately go to the Bitcoin blockchain to withdraw their funds or confirm
their transactions.
That's right.
OK.
Great.
And do you think that's your primary edge or differentiation versus all the other Bitcoin
layer 2s?
Or what is that differentiation?
Well, we have a number of features that differentiate.
As I mentioned, we're a much larger, much deeper team.
We've been working on Bitcoin for 15 years now.
Other teams can't match that.
We invented proof of proof mining.
We're not photocopying others' softwares.
We have the HVM, H stands for Hemi.
And what this is, it's a little bit of a technical explanation.
So I hope the viewers will bear with me.
We took an Ethereum node and we embedded a Bitcoin node inside it.
No other competitor has done this.
Now why do we do that?
It extends that Ethereum virtual machine, the EVM, to support reading and writing the
Bitcoin L1 chain from these advanced smart contracts.
And so for a developer, a Bitcoin developer, the Bitcoin developer in 2010, if we hopped
in a time machine, they only have this tiny, tiny little technical piece called Bitcoin
script.
It's very secure, but it's not programmable at all.
And thankfully, Vitalik came along, invented Ethereum, invented EVM, added 1000X to crypto
programmability.
But there were still two silos, Bitcoin and Ethereum, two different universes.
The word Hemi is short for hemispheres, and it refers to the Bitcoin hemisphere and the
Ethereum hemisphere coming together.
And so the coming togetherness, again, getting back to the technical, we created a HVM that
extends the EVM so it's fully backward compatible, yet it adds new features to let programmers
add programmability to their Bitcoin transactions.
So over here, you have a Bitcoin chain.
You can watch for payments on the Hemi chain, or on the Hemi chain, you can trigger a payment
and it appears over here on the Bitcoin chain.
So you don't have to do this thing and then bridge and do this other thing.
And it's just nicely integrated, seamless.
You don't have to undergo a multi-step process like other folks do.
So it's far more advanced and far more seamless going from Hemi to Bitcoin, Bitcoin to Hemi,
and it's real Bitcoin.
It's not wrapped, it's not rehypothecated Bitcoin, it's just direct on the L1 Bitcoin.
So we're a direct integration, a secure integration, and very, very deep tech.
So I'd say we have a number of technological advantages.
And then sociological, we have an amazing community already.
We have a test-first community nature.
So we launched Testnet last year, we launched Mainnet, and we test, test, test, test, test
on Testnet and have a very test-centric, safety-centric, de-risk type culture so that when we launch
apps on Hemi, it's already been beaten up, already seen Darwin's trial by fire.
And I think that is another advantage.
And then finally, the world, the market, not just Hemi, but the entire world is coming
back to Bitcoin DeFi.
So Hemi is the right product at the right time for what the market is looking for.
I try not to say this is Jeff's opinion for what we should build.
I try to say, what is the market telling us?
What is the market pulling us towards?
And the market is, institutionals interested in Bitcoin, Bitcoin maximalists becoming
more pragmatic and wanting on-chain yield in DeFi, the world governments and corporates
putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets.
And all of that plays into what we're building with Bitcoin and DeFi on Hemi.

I really want to get back to that topic, but first, just wanted to quick follow ups
on this Hemi-Bitcoin connection.
So one is, you said Bitcoin on Hemi is actually Bitcoin, like it's not a wrapped version,
it's the actual cryptocurrency.
And then on the bridging, how fast is that connection?
If you want to go from Bitcoin on Hemi to Bitcoin mainnet, how quickly can you do that?
Trying to remember the specific figures because it's different from going in versus coming
out.
If you're going from Bitcoin L1 to Hemi over our tunnel, we use slightly different language,
we call it a tunnel.
I believe that is three hours.
You get six confirmations and then three hours pass.
And then going the other way, it's 24 hours.
So it scales up time-wise to prevent fraud and other rung pulls and hacks and stuff like
that because you've got to be ultra secure with that level of money.
Once Bitcoin is out, it's gone.
Pretty similar to Ethereum and Ethereum layer 2's withdrawal times.
Exactly.
Though we're maybe 7x faster at the same time.
Their worst case is seven days and our worst case is 24 hours.
So I want to go back to this topic of the world coming back to Bitcoin.
I think it's super interesting.
What macro factors do you think are explaining this?
Macro factors, I think, get deep into philosophy and world events.
I think there's one theory that is called the fourth turning.
Every fourth generation throughout history, you kind of have a lot of chaos and war and
upheaval and nation states become new nation states.
I'm a history buff, so I love world history and all this sort of stuff.
And if that theory may or may not be correct, but we're certainly seeing a lot of upheaval
in world events today and that is trending people towards gold and that's also turning
people towards digital gold, which is Bitcoin.
You're seeing macro wise countries around the world, major countries like Japan and
China have stopped buying U.S. treasuries and there's traditionally been a lot of demand
for U.S. treasuries.
This leads the U.S. government to buy U.S. treasuries, buying its own printing, which
again leads people to look for currencies, sound money as it were, that's not inflating,
that's not being printed.
And so you see both physical and digital gold demand just skyrocketing in both the U.S.
and other countries around the world.
I think that's one of the big macro factors.
Another one a little bit closer to home, the U.S. politics on crypto has shifted quite
a bit with the change in administration.
There were in the previous administration some court cases that eventually resolved
to legalize Bitcoin ETFs.
And that was a big, big watershed moment in the life of sovereign crypto, institutional
crypto, corporate crypto, because once Bitcoin is held in security related arrangements,
broker dealer arrangements, collateral arrangements, it's essentially in traditional finance at
that point.
It's gotten the green light in traditional finance.
And Bitcoin, unlike the other cryptos, has that green light now.
Other cryptos are still seen as new, emerging, et cetera, super short data point.
The U.S. government was debating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a strategic crypto reserve.
Their first announcement, they were going to have XRP, SOL, and several other cryptos.
And then they withdrew that announcement and said, we're going to have a strategic Bitcoin
reserve.
And obviously, selfishly, as a Bitcoin holder, we like to see that.
But what's the deeper point?
The deeper point is that Bitcoin is one of one of mature cryptos that are available,
that have institutional support, sovereign support, corporate support, and all the others
are metaphorically emerging markets.
And so that is why all those reasons, I think, are why the world is coming back to Bitcoin.
Yeah, it's been such an interesting trend to watch, how Bitcoin has really decoupled
from stocks and has been rising as the U.S. dollar is weakening together with gold.
So it seems like all of Bitcoiners' predictions are finally coming true.
It's been wild to watch.
So do you think that Bitcoin can actually become a global reserve currency?
I absolutely think it's a global reserve currency today from certain perspectives.
And I think it's a part of a portfolio that becomes a global reserve currency, absolutely.
I like to think about the IMF SDR program, which it stands for special drawing rights,
but essentially it's a basket of world currencies and it's indexed a lot like an index fund
based on the GDP of each country in that index.
And I think Bitcoin, for example, deserves a spot in the IMF SDR alongside other world
currencies.
That'd be an interesting milestone to watch.
Do you think that ironically, now with all the pro-crypto regulation in the U.S., the
Genius Act, or at least like in the House now to be maybe approved, so stablecoins becoming
mainstream, do you think that could in turn prop up the dollar and maybe weaken Bitcoin's
case as kind of a dollar replacement?
That's a really good question.
I would say it's good for Bitcoin and good for the dollar.
So I'll take the 50% on that question.
I would say that stablecoins are very similar to the euro dollar system, which is a dollar
pegged system that extends internationally.
And I think stablecoins are essentially the new euro dollar system.
And that is extending the U.S. dollar to everywhere in the globe.
I really like the early vision of Jeremy Allaire at Circle, which as we record this just went
public, his early vision at Circle pre-stablecoin was global internet money.
And now Circle today with USDC, I think he's achieved his vision as stablecoins generalizing
are that global internet money.
Now is Bitcoin also global internet money?
I think the answer is also yes.
And so where does each apply and how does each apply?
I think pragmatism comes into play.
Right now Bitcoin in dollar terms, and we're all thinking in dollar terms, is very volatile.
And if you put your mortgage denominated in Bitcoin as a practical matter, you might one
day have a payment of $10,000 and another day a payment of $500.
And you'd like that small payment, you really wouldn't like that big payment.
You want stability in a 30-year financial instrument like a mortgage.
And right now the US dollar provides that.
And so for Bitcoiners, and we see this with Bitcoin DeFi, there is a lot of interest in
collateralizing Bitcoin and then using US dollar stablecoins for everyday spending,
for large purchases, and for other financial things like leveraging and other stuff.
And so it's very symbiotic, is my first point.
For the US government perspective, I think they're absolutely happy to have the US dollar
spread across the globe and have more dollars in circulation versus another currency.
And so if you ask many people I think in the US government, would you rather have US DPEG
stablecoins or something else, they'd certainly prefer US dollar PEG stablecoin.
So it extends the dollar, it extends the euro-dollar system.
And so I'm kind of a yes-to-both type of person.
Yeah, I mean, the point that Bitcoin can be collateral for a US dollar-based stablecoin
is a great point.
But we haven't seen that really take off so far.
So that leads to the other next question I wanted to ask, which is Bitcoin DeFi has until
now been an interesting idea, but it hasn't really become true in the sense that there
is an ecosystem, but I'm not sure that there's actual economic activity happening there.
Or I'd love your take on that, because it seems like a lot of the staking is to get
farming tokens, but it's not actual yield from lending or we're not seeing Bitcoin use
as collateral for stablecoins, like you said, or more kind of real-world use cases stemming
from Bitcoin DeFi.
I think you are, but you have to look holistically across multiple chains in crypto.
And what I mean by that is that Bitcoin itself, just the chain, is technologically limited
and literally can't do DeFi without help.
And that's part of where Hemi comes in.
But holistically, you'd see folks holding Bitcoin, they'd use a solution like Wrapped
or WBTC, and then they'll go on a lending market such as Aave or Compound, deposit that,
and then they do borrow stables.
And so what we're seeing number-wise is about two to four billion in collateralized Bitcoin
on DeFi, which is both a big number and a small number, in that a billion with a B is
obviously a big number.
There's obviously significant borrowing going on that supports multiple large ecosystems,
the WBTC, the MakerDAO, now Hemi as well, other systems.
And that's kind of part of the picture.
And I'd say the other part of the picture is ultimately folks who want to mine, they
want to generate yield.
That's the new emerging market where we don't have a lot of data yet.
But the collateralized BTC borrow USDC, you definitely see that if you zoom out and look
at it.
But like on Ethereum or like on other chains.
That's right.
I was meaning like Bitcoin DeFi on Bitcoin or Bitcoin sidechains.
It seems like maybe too early to see, like I don't know, I haven't seen that really taking
off yet.
It's literally impossible on Bitcoin.
So it's just not going to happen on Bitcoin.
And that's kind of where Hemi comes into play, is that we've got the Bitcoin DNA.
We've got EVM programmability.
We've got the HVM that can talk directly to Bitcoin L1.
And so the general idea is we're closer to Bitcoin than Ethereum.
So we want to challenge Ethereum's dominance in terms of Aave and other lending markets.
And I think we're on that road.
So how do you see it playing out, this challenge to Ethereum DeFi?
Well, obviously, I think we're going to win.
The closest to Bitcoin, some of the miner related integrations that we're pursuing,
we call that MinerFi.
To sidetrack a little bit into that, currently Bitcoin miners have a very simple user experience.
They have some mining hardware and to get paid, they register their Bitcoin address
and that's it.
And they just have a payment stream to their wallet and that's it.
Whereas Hemi and the top mining pools in Bitcoin are very interested in this, Hemi
extends that experience to, OK, and what next?
Meaning, OK, you receive this payment flow of Bitcoin and now you want to earn some yield
and now you want to swap that to USD to pay some bills.
And now you want to perform X, Y and Z automated actions based on AI agents, which is another
project that's on Hemi.
All of those automations are the and now what next form.
And so that's programmability in a nutshell and that's modularity, that's flexibility
and that's the system that we built with Hemi is that once you have your Bitcoin, there's
another universe of possibilities that we're opening up.
And so we think that that is going to be very compelling to Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin holders.
Basically, the Bitcoin maximalist is becoming the Bitcoin pragmatist, we argue, and that
pragmatism is I don't just want to hold my Bitcoin in a Bitcoin wallet inside a mountain
behind armed security guards and nothing ever happens with it.
I want it to grow like a savings account.
I want to do more with it.
One of the founders at another startup company bought a house with it.
He collateralized his Bitcoin, borrowed USD and purchased his entire house, you know,
real estate, California real estate.
So it was not cheap.
So did he do it on like on Aave?
Yeah, he did.
He used he used either compound or Aave.
I forget which.
So your dream is that the next time that happens, it'll be on a lending market on Hemi.
That's right.
That's right.
Exactly.
Hemi and more.
Do you think that now I think there's like about a hundred billion of TVL in DeFi overall.
Do you think Bitcoin DeFi has the potential to overtake that or to be the main hub of
DeFi?
Since Bitcoin is the biggest cryptocurrency, you could argue that, you know, there is a
potential to to have that happen.
We think it's going to be the biggest home for DeFi bar none.
Like I mentioned earlier, the institutional corporate sovereign retail grassroots, all
the support is there for Bitcoin.
And it's literally incomparable with any of the other cryptos in terms of that penetration
at the edge, meaning not just crypto enthusiasts of coin X, Y and Z, but banks, OCC chartered
banks, but hedge funds, SEC registered treasury companies.
All of these have a level of legal comfort, regulatory clarity with Bitcoin that you don't
have with other cryptos.
And so that's a big, big, big pull, magnetic pull kind of back to home base, back to the
root of the crypto tree.
What if sending crypto felt more human?
Pulse just launched Red Packets, a new way to gift tokens with meaning.
It's gasless, gamified and claimable inside group chats only.
Think AirDrops meet social cues on chain.
Backed by smart wallet tech and live across major L2s, Red Packets turn communities into
micro economies of gratitude and growth.
No seed phrases, no friction.
Best connection with value.
Check it out at Pulse.social.
So that's in terms of programmability and market cap that with Hemi, you kind of have
that going for you.
You have the volume, liquidity and market cap of Bitcoin, which is the biggest in the
space.
And you've integrated Ethereum CVM to make that programmable.
What about scalability and throughput?
Because Solana really took that one step further beyond what Ethereum and even Ethereum Layer
2s are doing with thousands of transactions per second, which very, very few chains can
achieve.
And we've seen how that's really prompted this meme coin mania and other more retail
use cases.
Do you see that also happening on Bitcoin or maybe that will continue to be more for
like other chains?
Oh, absolutely.
Bitcoin itself is going to continue to be a settlement layer, a backbone, the root of
the crypto tree.
And Hemi, for example, will be able to facilitate a lot of those high transaction volume type
use cases.
We have in our white paper outlined some designs for Layer 3 protocols that can go as fast
as you can transact.
So hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, theoretical maximum.
But the other trade-off, and we're not going to go to that level of speed with Hemi, the
core L2, is that we value decentralization.
And as you turn up the speed knob, you're turning down the decentralization knob.
And what do I mean by that?
We actually get to the laws of physics, the speed of light.
And when we're creating the consensus that this is a Hemi block, this is a Bitcoin block,
the messages literally have to travel all over the globe to every continent on Earth,
even Antarctica.
There are a couple of Bitcoin nodes in Antarctica.
To achieve consensus.
And that simply doesn't happen if you're doing 100,000 transactions per second, because the
speed of light can only go so far from Europe to Africa to South America to North America
and back again.
And so the current best guess is 200 to 500 milliseconds is your fastest time.
And if you're going any faster than that, you're compromising decentralization.
And you're just kind of putting all the servers in one data center again.
And you've recreated Amazon.com.
It's not decentralized at all.
And you have no censorship resistance whatsoever.
So if you want to compromise like that, you might as well just create a centralized database
and not use blockchain at all.
Right, for sure.
So it's really interesting stuff.
And if all that happened and there's DeFi and retail kind of activity happening on Bitcoin
layer 2s, does that risk Bitcoin losing on mainnet transactions?
Which I think we're already seeing some kind of indication that that's happening.
And we've seen that effect on Ethereum, how all the activity is moving to layer 2s.
And so L1 is missing out on those transaction costs.
ETH was underperforming, arguably in part because of that.
Do you see that as a risk for Bitcoin?
Well, some people theorize that 50 or 100 years down the line, when the per block subsidy
is just de minimis, it's basically gone, will transaction fees pay for network security?
That's kind of the existential question.
And from what we see on layer 2s, we are actually paying, specifically with Hemi, we're paying
Bitcoin fees and we're paying Ethereum fees and we're putting data in both blockchains.
And so that's continuing to support the network, continuing to pay those costs.
And the networks are both self-balancing such that if there's low traffic, then there's
very little contention.
If there's high traffic, there's high contention, high fees, et cetera.
And so it all kind of naturally balances out.
And so I'm a very Zen guy, very balanced.
I like the algorithmic nature of Bitcoin.
And I think it has several self-balancing aspects that'll help in those times when there's
low traffic or a lot of L1s, et cetera, or excuse me, L2s.
Ultimately you have to settle back to an L1.
So that's why I call it a settlement layer, a backbone to steal a Web2 phrase.
And it's always going to be needed.
It's always going to be that root of the security tree.
So I don't see it ever going away.
Yeah, that's a good point.
Okay.
Now, back to Hemi and next milestones, what are you looking forward to in the next few
months?
Sure.
Well, we have launched our testnet.
Test, test, test is the engineer's mantra.
We've launched our main net with Ethereum as the gas token.
The next milestones will involve increasing our vault security for going to and from Bitcoin
using a technology called BitVM2.
We're going to be unveiling gas tokens, which allow people to pay for gas for network fees
in Bitcoin itself, and a number of extensions to the protocol, which are going to make Bitcoin
DeFi faster, quicker, and more integrated with the mining pool experience.
And we're talking with a number of mining pools.
So we're looking at the upgrade of the user experience, the upgrade of the security experience.
But at the same time, transactions just keep on flowing and keep on getting secured.
What about the launch of your own token?
We are launching a Hemi token, but I'm providing literally zero details beyond that.
Okay.
We'll just have to wait and be patient, but at least we know that there is a Hemi token.
Yes.
Yes, there is.
Coming.
Coming soon.
Coming soon to a theater.
Interesting.
Okay.
What about the applications on Hemi?
Any interesting projects launching soon and related to that, how are you attracting developers
onto the network?
Sure.
Well, I'll take the last question first, is that there are a number of ways to attract
developers onto the network.
Obviously, just being amazing and just building a great developer experience at Block that
spun out Hemi Labs.
We're all builders.
We want to build things that other developers just want to bear hug and love.
And that's from great documentation to source code examples to hackathons to the monetary
side of grants and other monetary support.
If you're not a VC-backed project, you're just like a Stanford University student building
something, we want to encourage those independent developers to come and build on Hemi.
We have overthought the developer experience, and I think that really shows all the way
to our Discord community, which has a number of different developer-centric paths that
you can follow and other fellow developers you can network with.
So I just love our developer experience, and I've been having our team focus quite a bit
on that.
So that's, I think, pretty key.
Coming to Hemi, if you're not familiar with smart contracts and blockchain development,
it's definitely a steep learning curve, but it's absolutely worth it.
For your first part of your question, the apps, there are a number of different apps
that people are engaging with.
I'll bring them down in terms of monetary and non-monetary.
On the non-monetary side, there are some interesting games, demos, ways that folks can participate
through our Discord to learn more about Hemi.
There's something called Hemi Hatchlings, which is a free-to-ment, free-to-use experimental
NFT art project, and you can morph and hatch Pokemon characters, stuff like that.
We have a vibrant NFT art community that people engage with and really enjoy and have a lot
of fun with.
Does it use Ordinals for NFTs?
You can export to Ordinals, but it's primarily on the Hemi chain at the moment.
The financial apps, obviously, we're getting the 80%, 20% experience of 80% of people coming
in the door of their Bitcoin holders.
They want to do something with their Bitcoin.
20% are coming in through the Ethereum tunnel, Ethereum door, that sort of thing.
They want to do the standard DeFi apps of DEXs and lending markets.
The more aggressive traders are looking at PERP DEXs and dark pools and things of that
nature.
Vitalik, in a recent post, talked about how maybe blockchains are a little bit too public.
That reveals a little bit too much about you.
We should look at ZK and dark pools again as some of the ways that we can add privacy,
give privacy back to our users.
We're seeing some of those ZK privacy trading apps as well.
Interesting.
Very cool.
Then, to wrap up, I'd love a sense of your more long-term vision if everything works
out the way that you want.
What does Hemi look like?
To me, Bitcoin and Ethereum, the king and queen of crypto, they're always going to be
there.
We always want to be well integrated with the king and queen of crypto.
I think the future of Hemi is the future of layer 2s.
Layer 2s are absolutely necessary.
They're an organic outgrowth of you just can't fit everything on L1.
Fundamentally, you've got to have layer 2s to onboard the other 7 billion people on the
planet after we onboard the first billion.
From that perspective, we're going to integrate the Lightning Network.
We're going to integrate Solana and some of the other non-EVM blockchains, and ultimately,
I think, become the Bitcoin DeFi hub for all of crypto.
Awesome.
Great.
Finally, if you want to tell the audience where to find you or how to get started on
Hemi.
Yeah, go to Hemi.xyz.
