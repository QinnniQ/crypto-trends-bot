Ah, Ethereum.
Sorry, what?
Not so long ago, it was arguably one of the most hated cryptos out there,
with investors everywhere feeling the FUD and almost nobody feeling the FOMO.
Well, over the last few weeks, it looks like this has completely reversed,
with ETH's price going parabolic.
It's crazy how fast things can change in crypto, eh?
It's crazy.
That's why today, we're going to bring you up to speed with all of Ethereum's latest updates,
analyze ETH's price action, and determine just how high it could climb in the coming months.
My name is Guy, and unlike your boss's invite to that Coldplay concert,
this is a video you don't want to ignore.
Okay, before we begin, you need to know that I'm not a financial advisor,
and nothing in this video should be considered financial or investment advice.
This video is purely for educational purposes,
meant to inform you about the latest updates with Ethereum.
So, if that sounds good to you, fire up those like and subscribe buttons,
and slap that notification bell too, so you don't miss our next one.
Now, our last Ethereum update was back in March of this year,
when ETH was underperforming not only against BTC, but most of the crypto market.
It was bleeding heavily against Bitcoin,
and there was no significant rally for us to get excited about.
In fact, if you watched that video, you'll recall that ETH was trading at bear market levels,
and sentiment was in the toilet.
Safe to say, a lot has changed since then.
As I record this, Bitcoin dominance is in freefall,
and altcoins are finally getting their moment.
And the wild part? Ethereum is leading the charge.
So then, what changed?
How did ETH go from laughing stock to cool kid at the party?
Well, while everyone looked away, and while Vitalik was busy meowing at robots,
Ethereum's devs doubled down.
In early May, Ethereum rolled out its long-awaited Pectra upgrade,
a hard fork that implemented 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs.
Each EIP improved some part of the network,
whether through enhanced performance or an improved user experience, or UX.
Of the 11 EIPs rolled out, three in particular caught the eye.
EIP 7251 improved the UX for validators by increasing the staking limit from 32 ETH
to 2048 ETH, allowing their operations to be more consolidated.
EIP 7691 enhanced Layer 2 scalability by increasing the amount of data blobs
that can be processed in each block.
And the EIP that people were most excited about was EIP 7702,
which enabled smart wallets.
Basically, wallets that are treated as smart contracts
and can cover transaction fees in any Ethereum-based token, not just ETH.
And what's more is that Pectra is the first of three major upgrades.
Later in the year, there will be another hard fork called Fusaka,
which will be followed by Glamsterdam,
and no, that's not a music festival with lots of glitter, despite what it sounds like.
But Pectra wasn't the only big change.
The Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit supporting Ethereum's development,
also saw a major shift.
In late April, it underwent a change in leadership,
which many hoped would spark renewed excitement for Ethereum.
And this was a big deal because the Foundation was getting a lot of the blame
for ETH's underperformance, mainly due to them repeatedly selling large chunks of ETH.
Naturally, that didn't look great, and many believed it was suppressing ETH's price.
Since the leadership change, though, the Foundation has adopted a more transparent
treasury policy and will release quarterly and annual reports to outline its holdings,
investment performance, and any other significant developments.
But perhaps most importantly, the Ethereum Foundation turned to supplying and borrowing
from DeFi protocols like Aave to fund its operations, rather than dumping large amounts
of ETH at a time.
Oh, and you can learn about who's now running the Ethereum Foundation
by checking out the video right over here.
But leadership wasn't the only thing that the Foundation changed.
In early June, it rebranded its Protocol Research and Development, or PR&D team,
to just Protocol, laying off a load of staff in the process.
The new Protocol team will focus primarily on three areas.
Layer 1 scalability, expanding blob space for roll-ups, and improving Ethereum's UX.
Oh, and one more big change since our last update is the spot Ethereum ETF flows.
Back then, Ethereum ETFs were flip-flopping between inflows and outflows,
so they didn't really support ETH's price.
However, this trend changed in April,
and inflows have been significantly larger than outflows ever since.
So, lots of key moves for Ethereum, but how have they affected ETH's price?
Well, if it wasn't obvious before, ETH is now far out of the bear market territory
it found itself stuck in.
In fact, since our last update, it's rallied from about $2,000 to around $3,700
at the time of shooting.
Now, this is great news for ETH holders, but even better news for anyone who bought in February
after Eric Trump tweeted, quote,
In my opinion, it's a great time to add ETH.
The funny part is that ETH's price roughly halved in the weeks after,
but nevertheless, Eric later replied to his own tweet with a mic drop when,
five months later, ETH was 30% higher than at the start.
Well, a win is a win, I suppose.
The caveat is that at the time of shooting,
ETH has yet to reclaim its previous all-time high of around $4,900.
In fact, ETH has been flirting with the $4,000 mark,
but hasn't quite managed to push past it.
This is in stark contrast to many competing altcoins
that have already set new all-time highs and are positioned to keep on climbing.
Oh, and if you're looking to trade ETH or any other crypto as they head to the moon,
then you'll want to check out the Coin Bureau deals page.
That's because you can find sign-up bonuses of up to $100,000,
trading fee discounts of up to 50%,
and deposit cashbacks of up to 75% on crypto exchanges.
Now, these deals won't be around forever, so click the link down below while you still can,
or you can scan this QR code.
But back to Ethereum.
Now, while it's great that ETH's price has soared in dollar terms,
it's even better news that ETH is finally gaining strength over BTC.
For those unaware, ETH has been bleeding against its BTC pair since way back in September 2022.
Specifically, between September 2022 and April 2025, ETH lost around 80% of its BTC value,
which is crazy considering that they're the two largest cryptos by market cap.
However, in early May, ETH finally began to regain some of its strength against BTC
and has since rallied by 75% on its BTC pair.
Still a long way to go, but this is a strong start nonetheless.
What's crazy is that ETH has even been gaining strength over Solana's SOL,
which is arguably its biggest competitor.
As it happens, SOL has been bleeding against ETH since April,
falling by around 40%, which really puts ETH's performance into perspective.
And if you want to see how Ethereum measures up against Solana,
then you can check out our recent comparison video right over here.
So, by this point then, it's clear that ETH is finally starting to move up and to the right,
but it still has a long way to go before it breaks above its previous all-time high.
The question now is what future milestones does Ethereum have that could drive ETH's price even
higher? Well, Vitalik has a clear vision for Ethereum and privacy is a big part of it.
In April, he unveiled a new privacy-focused roadmap aiming to add privacy tools to Ethereum
wallets to keep transactions anonymous and boost privacy across the ecosystem.
Notably, he said, quote,
users should not have to download a separate privacy wallet.
That same month, Vitalik wrote a blog post titled, quote,
Why I Support Privacy.
And we'll leave a link to the blog in the description,
but the TLDR is that Vitalik believes that privacy equals freedom.
Anyway, besides privacy, Vitalik has proposed boosting Ethereum's execution layer scalability
by replacing the EVM programming language with RISC-V.
This is a radical move, but he argues that bold steps like this
might be the only way to break through Ethereum's bottlenecks.
And Vitalik isn't the only one working to improve Ethereum.
In April, the Ethereum Foundation announced a shift towards layer 1 scaling and better UX.
So, while Vitalik focuses on privacy and speed,
the Foundation is enhancing scalability for the layer 1 and layer 2s
and improving interoperability through upcoming hard forks.
Now, to refresh your memory, Ethereum's Pectra upgrade went live on the 7th of May,
introducing smart wallets, validator UX improvements and layer 2 scalability enhancements.
The next hard fork will be Fusaka, which is expected to roll out in November.
Just like Pectra, Fusaka will implement 11 EIPs.
Highlight include EIP 7825, which boosts scaling while making the network tougher against attacks,
and EIP 7892, which introduces small incremental hard forks to gradually scale data blob sizes.
The most anticipated EIP, though, is 7594, which brings Peer Data Availability Sampling,
aka Peer DAS.
Now, basically, Peer DAS lets nodes on Ethereum's beacon chain, the consensus layer,
perform data availability sampling.
And this lets validators download just small parts of a blob's data instead of the whole thing,
helping validators and cutting layer 2 transaction costs significantly.
It's important to note, though, that the list of Fusaka's EIPs isn't final and could change,
but Peer DAS is reportedly the only EIP that Ethereum devs unanimously agree on.
Also, Ethereum devs are known for delays, so don't be too surprised if the upgrade
gets pushed back past November.
Anyway, after Fusaka is Glamsterdam, although no date has been set at the time of shooting.
In fact, the list of EIPs to be included in Glamsterdam is currently unconfirmed,
although these details are set to be confirmed on the 1st of August.
What we do know, though, is that Glamsterdam will primarily focus on gas optimization
and protocol efficiency improvements, put differently, making Ethereum faster and
cheaper to use, which, let's be honest, is much needed for Ethereum to stay competitive.
Oh, and don't worry, you can bet that we'll keep you updated on these upgrades
closer to the time, so make sure you're subscribed to the channel.
Anyway, aside from developments with the Ethereum network, there's another major
development that could help with Ethereum's adoption and attract a new wave of investors.
That's because asset managers everywhere have been filing with the SEC
to add staking to their spot Ethereum ETFs, which could attract serious investment.
That's simply because it would enable traditional and institutional investors to earn a yield.
What's encouraging is that ETF issuers are racing to be the first approved for a staking ETF,
hoping to attract eager investors before anyone else.
Now, whether the SEC approves all some or none remains to be seen.
But the SEC is predicted to make this decision by the end of Q3 this year,
and a sudden surge in spot Ethereum ETF inflows implies that investors and asset managers
expect them to be approved and soon.
This would likely be rocket fuel for ETH's price.
Consider that some analysts predict it could bring in between $20 and $30 billion annually.
With all that said, however, this does beg the question of what challenges Ethereum might face
next. Perhaps the most obvious challenge is competition from other layer 1 blockchains
like Solana, Sui, Aptos and many more.
Even with upgrades, Ethereum is still slower and more expensive to use than these rivals.
In the short term, this could result in ETH underperforming against these competing
blockchains, which isn't helped by the fact that Ethereum has the second largest market cap behind
Bitcoin. Naturally, competing cryptos with lower market caps will have more upside potential.
The caveat, though, is that Ethereum's development is focused on long-term improvements
that will help future-proof it as a network.
This means that each upgrade is being carefully planned and executed rather than each one being
rushed and containing potential imperfections.
This will make Ethereum more stable and secure, which for many will make ETH a more attractive
long-term investment.
This stability is also a key reason why Ethereum is being embraced by Wall Street,
which is largely adopting it to launch tokenized real-world assets or RWAs.
In any case, this relates to the second challenge that Ethereum faces and that's
fragmented liquidity.
While the speed and cost efficiency of layer 2s are beneficial to Ethereum's overall UX,
many investors also believe that the proliferation of layer 2s will ultimately result in liquidity
being siloed to separate layer 2 chains, meaning there's less overall demand for ETH.
Some critics also argue that the sheer number of layer 2s creates additional layers of complexity,
which presents additional challenges to Ethereum's UX.
However, what many don't consider is that DeFi activity on these protocols continues to rise.
So, while ETH isn't necessarily being used for fees, it is being used more frequently
as collateral and as a trading pair.
Put differently, the demand for ETH is still very much there, just in the ways you might
perhaps not expect.
This is especially true when you consider that roughly half of all stablecoins are issued
on Ethereum and around 60% of DeFi activity happens on Ethereum too, and that's not even
counting its layer 2 ecosystem.
So, as institutions dive into DeFi and tokenized RWAs, Ethereum is set to attract the most
capital inflows.
But, while perhaps not an obvious challenge, there's a more immediate and serious threat
which is that Pectra's smart wallets have a potential attack vector for hackers.
Basically, hackers could exploit a new transaction type to take control of a wallet
just through a message signature, without the user signing an actual transaction.
So, just connecting a smart wallet to a phishing site could drain all the funds.
The worst part is that these attacks have already happened.
And while wallet providers and security advocates have warned users not to sign unfamiliar
off-chain messages or delegation requests, a fix has yet to be rolled out.
For what it's worth though, the Ethereum Foundation has also created the so-called
Trillion Dollar Security Initiative which aims to identify and communicate with developers
areas where security can be improved.
Ironically, this initiative was announced on the 14th of May, exactly one week after
Pectra was rolled out.
Anyway, this all brings us to the big question.
How high could ETH's price go?
Well, to determine this, let's take a look at what some respected market analysts have
to say.
Although, we will reiterate what we said at the beginning.
Nothing in this video is financial or investment advice.
So, let's start with Standard Chartered, which late last year gave an impressive price
prediction of $10,000.
However, in March this year, the firm released a report titled, quote,
Ethereum Midlife Crisis, accusing the base layer 2 blockchain of removing around $50
billion from Ethereum's market cap.
As a result, Standard Chartered slashed its prediction by 60% to just $4,000, implying
that not only will ETH not pump, but it won't even reclaim its previous all-time high.
Then there's our good friend Benjamin Cowan, who used his formidable analytics skills to
predict that a realistic target for ETH could be anywhere between $5,700 and $7,500 for
this market cycle.
We'll leave a link to Ben's video down below and we recommend you check it out if
you have the time.
Anyway, another price prediction comes from a chap called Gert van Lagen, who predicted
that ETH could hit $8,000 using a technical analysis method called Elliott Wave Theory.
However, investors typically love a good round number and as such, there's one price
target that most have in the back of their minds at least, $10,000.
Analysts everywhere are eyeing up $10k if only because this would be a huge area of
psychological resistance.
Now from our perspective, there is a decent chance that ETH could reach this hallowed
level if not exceeded.
The reason for this optimism is a combination of the things we've covered in today's video.
Spot Ethereum ETFs are on the rise and the high likelihood of the SEC approving staking
for these products will lead to a surge in capital inflows.
Ethereum also continues to dominate the broader crypto market with the lion's share of on-chain
DeFi activity happening within its ecosystem.
On top of this, though, there's one more major catalyst that could drive ETH's price
beyond the expectations of many investors and that's the proliferation of companies
adding ETH to their balance sheets in a similar way that Michael Saylor's strategy has been
accumulating BTC.
For instance, SharpLink Gaming, which FYI is chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joseph
Lubin, currently holds over 360,000 ETH at the time of shooting.
There's also Bitmine, which is shifting away from just being a Bitcoin mining company
to also becoming an Ethereum treasury company.
Bitmine currently holds more than 300,000 ETH.
And there's also Bitdigital, another crypto mining company that now holds over 120,000 ETH.
The point is, though, while this trend continues to gain momentum,
this will naturally drive up demand for ETH, pushing its price up and to the right in the process.
Combine this with Ethereum's growing institutional adoption,
massive spot ETF inflows and investors finally taking ETH seriously again,
and it's clear this rally is just getting started.
We won't put a number on it, but put it this way.
Investors have been laughing at Ethereum for a long time,
but it's ETH holders who will have the last laugh.
