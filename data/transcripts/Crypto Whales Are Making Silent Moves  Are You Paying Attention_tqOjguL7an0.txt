Investors everywhere look to the charts to forecast the next market move.
But they're often looking in the wrong place.
You're looking in the wrong place.
And that's because big money is moving behind closed doors through the over-the-counter or OTC market.
And that's why when we saw a recently published report revealing the activity of OTC traders,
we knew we had to cover it.
So today, we'll break down this report for you in simple terms
and tell you what it could mean for the crypto market.
My name is Nick. Stay tuned.

and nothing in this video should be considered financial or investment advice.
This video is purely educational and intended to inform you about crypto's OTC market.

Now the report we'll be summarizing for you today is titled quote
OTC Market Review Report 1H25.
It was written by Wintermute, one of crypto's leading market makers and OTC dealers.
We'll be summarizing the highlights right here in this video
and we'll leave a link to the full report in the description for you to come back and read later.
Wintermute begins by noting that its OTC trading data for the first half of 2025
found several trends.
Notably, retail and institutional investors are diverging in their market approaches.
Institutions continue to focus on major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum,
while retail is shifting toward altcoins.
And although memecoin activity has faded, the number of new tokens traded has doubled.
And this makes sense when you consider that we're finally starting to see some activity
in the altcoin market.
Speaking of which, if you're looking to trade crypto,
then you better check out the Coin Bureau deals page.
That's where you'll find sign-up bonuses of up to $100,000 on the best exchanges,
trading fee discounts of 50% and cashbacks on deposits of 75%.
These deals won't be around for long, so take advantage of them ASAP

Back to the vid.
Now, the report also highlights a 412% jump in OTC options trading compared to the first half of 2024.
Moreover, the number of traded contracts for difference, or CFDs, has doubled.
Now, for those unaware, a CFD is a financial contract that bets on the price of an asset
without actually owning the asset itself.
It's kind of like a perpetual futures contract.
Anyway, the report highlights growing TradFi engagement with tokenization platforms,
including a shift towards tokenized equity.
Notably, Wintermute recorded a 32% increase year-on-year
in OTC volumes from TradFi institutions for these tokenized RWAs.
The report also notes that trading volumes also spiked in early 2025,
but normalized in Q2 as macro catalysts subsided.
Activity was also increasingly concentrated around established assets like BTC and ETH
and is consolidating around specific themes.
The report then points to the improving regulatory landscape with regulatory clarity
coming from the EU markets in Cryptoassets Bill or MICA
and the Genius Act in the US, the latter of which was just signed into law by President Trump.
Next, Wintermute reveals that its OTC spot volumes in the first half of 2025
outperformed overall exchange volumes by 2.4 times.
Specifically, spot trading on centralized exchanges grew by 7%,
while OTC volumes rose by 18%, indicating that institutional investors
prefer executing large trades outside of exchanges.
The report then turns to OTC derivatives,
which have seen major growth in the first half of this year,
largely driven by institutional demand.
CFDs continued their momentum from last year,
with the number of tradable underlying assets rising from 15 to 34,
reflecting growing interest in capital-efficient exposure to crypto
without directly owning those underlying assets.
Options trading saw little change in asset variety.
BTC and ETH still made up 96% of OTC volumes.
But annualized trading volume have soared 230% from 2024
and 412% compared to the first half of 2024.
And the surge is driven by investors using options to hedge risk
and also to generate some yield.
Now, the report also notes that CFDs are expanding into altcoins.
ETH has already nearly doubled its share of CFD volumes since 2024,
while XRP and sole activity has dropped.
Still, overall altcoin CFD volumes have tripled,
with institutions showing a clear interest in cryptos
with a market cap below $1 billion.
Okay, the next part of the report highlights the growing gap
between institutional and retail investors.
In 2024, both were rotating into smaller, riskier projects,
but this wasn't the case for the first half of 2025.
Institutions stuck with larger cryptos,
while retail pushed deeper into smaller altcoins.
The report notes a few reasons for this.
First, institutions face a few constraints,
like limited altcoin liquidity and mandates
that keep them from taking on too much risk.
At the same time, BTC and ETH have regained appeal with institutions,
driven by heavy accumulation from governments like El Salvador
and corporations like Strategy.
Meanwhile, retail investors, free from the same restrictions,
have been rotating into altcoin narratives,
including the likes of decentralized AI, DeFi, Deepen, and others.
Wintermute notes that, quote,
we believe this change reflects a shift in risk appetites
and is an early sign of the market maturing,
with institutions sticking with proven majors,
while retail explores the longer tail of innovation.
To illustrate this split, the report includes a chart
showing OTC spot volumes changes in major cryptos.
From 2023 to 2024, institutional OTC shares dropped from 74% to 67%,
and retail shares from 55% to 46%.
Between 2024 and 2025, though, institutional allocation didn't budge,
while retail fell further to 37%.
The report then looks at trading momentum.
After a strong 2024, 2025 began with heightened optimism
as BTC broke through $100,000.
The report attributes 2024's Q4 rally to the US elections,
but says momentum steadied after President Trump's inauguration.
By spring, enthusiasm had waned,
leading to reduced price action and volatility.
The report also notes that, unlike the 2024 hype
around meme coins and AI agents,
there wasn't really a dominant theme in the first half of 2025,
meaning that broader market sentiment stayed relatively muted.
The report adds that, quote,
with BTC hovering near all-time highs,
the market remains in a wait-and-see mode,
buoyed by headlines but lacking a unifying catalyst.
Well, safe to say that since this report was published,
investors have decided that they've waited way too long,
because altcoin season is flying, am I right?
In any case, this trend was reflected in 2025 OTC flows,
where institutions front-loaded activity in the first few months before easing off,
while retail has filled the void since by rotating into altcoins,
something which has become more obvious in spot markets in recent weeks.
Next, Wintermute explains that in 2025 OTC spot flows have moved towards
institutions and retail brokers,
which is evidence of crypto becoming more mainstream.
Institutional adoption has grown,
supported by increased regulatory clarity,
while mainstream advisory is pushing to allocate
a higher share of portfolios to crypto,
which is driving retail participation.
Meanwhile, crypto natives are more cautious than in early 2024,
due to a lack of stand-out speculative narratives.
Instead, investors are more focused on regulatory clarity
and crypto's growing maturity and adoption as an asset class.
Okay, the next part of the report takes a closer look
at trading activity in different crypto sectors.
That's because across all investor types,
retail, institutional, TradFi,
capital has been consolidating around nine specific sectors.
The report ranks these nine sectors by their share of OTC spot volumes,
with one being the largest and nine being the smallest.
In order of size, these are as follows.
Currency networks, including Bitcoin.
General purpose blockchain networks, including Ethereum.
Stablecoin protocols.
Memes.
Decentralized finance, or DeFi.
Blockchain utility and tools.
Media, arts, and entertainment.
Centralized finance, or SeFi.
And decentralized physical infrastructure, or Deepin.
Anyway, throughout 2024 and the first half of 2025,
the rank of each sector stayed the same.
But capital became more concentrated in three areas.
Currency networks.
General purpose blockchain networks.
And blockchain utility and tools.
Elsewhere, smaller sectors like Deepin and SeFi saw the largest declines.
Notably, retail investors moved to emerging narratives,
which apparently includes stablecoins.
Institutional investors have favored crypto infrastructure.
And a whopping 96% of TradFi capital has stayed with BTC,
layer 1 cryptos like ETH, and stablecoin protocols.
In fact, the only shift in rankings in 2025 was stablecoins,
which overtook memecoins to become one of the top three sectors.
The report notes that between 2024 and 2025,
both institutions and retail pulled back from smaller narratives like Deepin and DeFi.
But they diverged into two areas.
Stablecoins and media, arts, and entertainment,
which saw more retail trading and reduced activity from institutions.
The report adds that stablecoins gained traction in Q2,
likely due to the then pending stablecoin regulations in the US.
Conversely, media, arts, and entertainment is rebounding after overheating last cycle.
A retail is slowly returning while institutions continue to move further away.
The other divergence is in SeFi, which has seen the opposite play out.
More trading activity from institutions and less trading activity from retail.
The report notes that,
the institutional bid has been driven primarily by names like BNB and Crow.
The report then asks a question I'm sure many of you are also wondering.
What about memecoins?
Well, after dominating in 2024, memecoin activity dropped in 2025.
Flows have shifted from legacy names like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu
to newer tokens like Bonk, Dogwith Hat, and Popcat,
which have grown their trading share from 0.7% to 5.3%.
But more interestingly, investor behavior has shifted.
Institutions are sticking to a smaller range of memecoins
while retail investors have more than doubled the amount of memecoins they're willing to trade.
That said though, overall spot OTC memecoin volumes are down.
Annualized activity in 2025 has dropped 29% from 2024 and 17% compared to the first half of 2024.
As legacy memes like Doge or Shib continue to lose dominance to memes like Bonk,
Whiff, and Popcat, OTC meme trading has become more fragmented.
The report adds that,
this is evidenced by the share of smaller, long-tail memecoins
rising from 0.7% to 16.1% of total flow.
Unsurprisingly, this memecoin expansion was almost entirely driven by retail,
with 23 memes now being traded OTC.
Next, the report analyzes different sub-sectors in crypto
to see what's driving the trading activity in each narrative.
In their words,
this granular approach allows us to later zoom out
and identify more structural trends across both existing and emerging narratives.
The report then reveals which sub-sectors have seen an uptrend or downtrend in OTC activity.
In the blockchain utilities and tools sector,
the sub-sectors that have seen the uptrend are interoperability cryptos and scalability cryptos.
Meanwhile, the data and analytics providers are the only sub-sector
within the utilities and tools narrative that reportedly saw a downtrend.
In the DeFi narrative, three sub-sectors were in an uptrend and none were in a downtrend.
These growing sub-sectors include asset origination and issuance cryptos,
DeFi infrastructure and data, and managed yield services.
In the deeper narrative, one sub-sector grew while another declined.
The area that grew was computation, while storage cryptos were in a downtrend.
As for the media arts and entertainment sector,
unfortunately, no sub-sectors experienced an uptrend,
but the metaverse sub-sector saw a downtrend, which isn't too surprising all things considered.
Now, in the final part of the report,
Wintermute takes a reflective look back to its predictions for 2025.
All in all, there were nine predictions made.
Six predictions turned out to be accurate, two were partly correct,
and just one was completely wrong.
Prediction one was that the US would create a strategic Bitcoin reserve,
and that China, the UAE and Europe would be forced to follow.
Wintermute claims it got this prediction right, but we're not so convinced.
Obviously, the US has created a Bitcoin reserve,
and more recently Pakistan announced plans to follow suit.
But as for China, there's only speculation, and there's very little evidence, if any,
of the UAE or Europe creating strategic Bitcoin reserves of their own.
Anyway, the second prediction was that a listed company would issue debt or shares
to accumulate ETH, which was bang on.
Several firms have done just that in 2025.
These include Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions, or BTCS,
now holding over 31,000 ETH,
Sharp Link Gaming, now with over 280,000 ETH,
and Bitmine Immersion, holding 300,000 ETH.
Wintermute's third prediction also hit the mark.
A company dividends, acquisitions or mergers would be settled using stablecoins.
Back in March, MGX Fund Management, which is backed by the Abu Dhabi government,
completed a $2 billion investment in Binance,
and this was the largest ever investment in a crypto company,
and was settled using the USD1 stablecoin.
The fourth prediction was one that came only part true,
which was that a core asset manager would launch a memecoin ETF,
with Doge being a strong contender.
Well, although multiple asset managers have filed for a spot Doge ETF,
none have been approved as of yet.
The SEC has until October to make a final decision.
The fifth prediction was one that Wintermute got absolutely wrong,
which was that a member of the FAANG index would launch its own token or major exchange.
Now, for those unaware, FAANG stands for Facebook, now Meta,
Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which is now Alphabet.
Anywho, while companies are now exploring tokenized equity,
no FAANG companies have jumped on board, at least not yet.
However, the report states that, quote,
while admittedly more in the moonshot category,
we view this as the natural next step in the evolution of tokenized fractionalization.
Just imagine the potential gains if that were to happen.
The sixth prediction was only half right.
A, quote,
systemically important bank would offer direct spot crypto trading to clients.
If we're not mistaken though,
Standard Chartered's most recent announcement that it would start
offering Bitcoin and Ethereum trading to clients means that this prediction came true after all,
as it's technically considered to be a systemically important bank.
The seventh prediction was spot on as well.
Dispersion trades, which are basically bets on price differences between different cryptos,
became more popular, boosting demand for structured products.
Activity in Bitcoin options has surged, a clear sign of market maturity.
Since the start of the year, open interest in BTC options has nearly tripled,
from $11.6 billion to $31.3 billion.
And this shows rising institutional activity and more use of volatility strategies,
setting the stage for advanced positioning in the future.
The eighth prediction was also correct.
A non-EVM Layer 1 and Layer 2 cryptos gained market share, but Ethereum remained dominant.
Key metrics like TVL, on-chain volume, daily users and market share have remained fairly steady,
with no real threats to Ethereum's dominance, though some would say this is up for debate.
And finally, the ninth prediction was also correct,
which was that DEXs will see strong gains in market share if abstraction products become
more widely adopted.
DEXs have continued to capture market share in the spot markets,
hosting 80% of the total spot trading volumes,
which is up from 11% in 2024 and 10% from the first half of last year.
And this growth reflects deeper liquidity and rising user comfort,
thanks to abstraction tools that simplify on-chain interactions.
The report notes that if this trend continues,
DEXs market share will likely keep on rising.
And with that folks, we've reached the end of this report,
and I'll remind you that you can find the full thing in the description below.
For now though, there's just one more question remaining.
What does all of this mean for the crypto market?
Well, if there's one thing that's clear from this report,
it's that institutional and traditional investors continue to be interested in major cryptos like
Bitcoin and Ethereum, while retail investors are the ones leading the charge into the broader
crypto market, even with cryptos being traded OTC.
What you probably already know is that OTC trades allow large investors to buy or sell
huge amounts of crypto with minimal impact on the wider market, if any.
What you might not know though, is that OTC trades actually help support overall market liquidity.
Since OTC DEXs connect traders that often trade amounts
far exceeding the daily trading volumes on exchanges.
Put differently, OTC markets arguably help keep the wheels in motion,
so a naturally stronger OTC market means a stronger overall crypto market.
And, as we've learned, the OTC market seems to be booming.
That said, since this report was published,
dynamics in the crypto market have shifted somewhat, and for multiple reasons.
On the one hand, the altcoin market is finally showing signs of life, with many cryptos finally
getting the long overdue rally that investors everywhere have been praying for.
On the other hand, the US has taken greater steps towards regulatory clarity,
with President Trump signing the Genius Act into law on the 18th of July,
providing some much needed clarity on stablecoins.
The next big step is the Clarity Act.
While the Genius Act targets stablecoins, the Clarity Act focuses on market structure,
which some argue is even more important.
Among other things, the Clarity Act aims to make digital commodities on mature blockchains
exempt from the Outdated Securities Act of 1933,
and hands market oversight from the SEC over to the CFTC.
Notably, the Clarity Act has already passed the House and is headed to the Senate,
along with Representative Tom Emmer's bill to block the Fed from launching a dystopian-style
central bank digital currency, or CBDC.
And you can learn more about the Clarity Act right over here.
Now, the point is that this will attract even more market institutional and traditional investors,
meaning huge amounts of capital flowing into the crypto market.
And given that cryptos are already starting to rally like crazy,
this suggests that many altcoins could rally to new all-time highs,
even higher than many are expecting.
So strap in folks, because if you think market sentiment is good now,
then well, you ain't seen nothing yet.
