Remember when BRICS was supposed to dethrone the dollar and reshape the global order?
What happened after that?
Well, ever since Donald Trump returned to office, they've been real quiet about that.
Xi Jinping just goes to the latest summit, Putin's been hiding behind a webcam,
and the whole bloc is beginning to look a bit more like a support group for countries
with US tariff anxiety than a vehicle for revolutionary change.
But here's the thing, while they're keeping quiet on the surface,
something interesting is brewing underneath.
Today we investigate what's really going on with BRICS in the age of Trump 2.0.
My name is Nick and you're watching the Coin Bureau.
The BRICS bloc was riding high just a year ago.
They expanded from 5 to 10 members, adding the UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia and Iran to the original
crew of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, with Saudi Arabia invited but still
considering membership.
Putin was hosting summits and giving the West the middle finger.
Xi was promising a new era of international relations.
They had payment systems in development, local currency trading was on the rise and
there was enough collective economic muscle to make Washington nervous.
Everyone was excited about de-dollarization.
But then Trump won the US election and suddenly the music stopped.
The tough talk about replacing the dollar vanished faster than a crypto
influencer's credibility in a bear market.
The grand plans for a new financial architecture quietly shelved.
And when it came time for the big summit in Rio this July, we got the biggest plot twist yet.
Xi Jinping didn't show up.
This is a guy who hasn't missed a major BRICS gathering since coming to power in 2012.
Think about that.
13 years of perfect attendance through the pandemic, border conflicts,
international crises and, yes, a trade war with Donald Trump's United States.
But suddenly, when it comes time to show up in Brazil and face down Trump 2.0,
Beijing sent Premier Li Kuang instead, citing scheduling conflicts.
The truth is that Xi saw the writing on the wall, or on truth social, I guess.
Back in November, just days after winning the election, Trump posted on his social
media platform, quote, we require a commitment from these countries that they will neither
create a new BRICS currency nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar,
or they will face 100% tariffs.
And just in case anyone thought he was bluffing, Trump doubled down in July,
adding an extra 10% tariff on any country that, and I quote,
aligns themselves with the anti-American policies of BRICS.
He even said that losing the dollar's reserve currency status would be like,
quote, losing a war, a major world war.
And when you frame it like that, suddenly his nuclear option tariff policies start to
make a bit of sense.
The dollar, as the world's reserve currency, is the financial architecture that underpins
American power.
And this is far more important to any US president than trade imbalances and manufacturing
jobs.
Trump's message was clear.
Challenge dollar dominance and face economic warfare.
Trump's approach is as subtle as a sledgehammer, but the impact on BRICS was immediately
visible.
The Rio summit itself became a study in damage control, carefully choreographed to avoid
giving Trump any ammunition for his tariff threats.
So, does this mean that the BRICS are in full retreat mode now?
Well, not quite, because it's still expanding.
Indonesia has now joined as the first Southeast Asian member, becoming the 10th full member.
And multiple countries have become partner nations.
These include Nigeria, Malaysia, and Thailand.
So the bloc that's supposedly folding is somehow still attracting new members.
So what gives, and what happened at that summit anyway?
Well, you had Brazil's president Lula playing host, desperately trying to balance Chinese
investment with American market access.
A Putin joined, but it was via Zoom, because setting foot in Brazil means getting arrested
thanks to an ICC warrant, not exactly a power move.
With Xi absent, Modi strutted around like he owned the place, because, essentially,
he did.
According to CNN, Modi got the full red carpet treatment.
For a bloc that's supposed to be about multi-polarity, it was, ironically,
dominated by a single poll.
The summit dynamics were fascinating.
Without Xi there to provide a counterweight, India basically became the de facto leader.
Brazil tried to keep things focused on safe topics like climate finance.
Russia pushed for more aggressive de-dollarization measures, but found little support.
The new members mostly kept quiet.
Despite this awkwardness, they did produce some results.
According to the official BRICS website, they signed 126 commitments and established
new cooperation mechanisms.
They announced the BRICS Leaders Framework Declaration on Climate Finance and a
Multilateral Guarantee Initiative, which is supposed to be like the World Bank's
investment guarantee programs, but without Western influence.
But the real story wasn't what they announced.
It's what they didn't.
There was no timeline given for a BRICS currency, no concrete plans for replacing
SWIFT, no grand declarations of independence from the dollar system.
Instead, we got diplomatic boilerplate about strengthening cooperation and
promoting development.
And by the way, if you're enjoying this video, why not strengthen your cooperation
with us by subscribing to the channel.
And while you're at it, you can promote our development by smashing that like button too.
Good on you.
So the cracks are starting to show.
Iran actually rejected part of this year's summit declaration, specifically the bit
about a two-state solution for Palestine.
And that's the first time a BRICS member has publicly broken ranks on an official statement.
The India-China rivalry is an even bigger problem, though.
These two are like the couple that stays together for the kids but can't stop
fighting at dinner parties.
They've got over $118 billion in bilateral trade, making them deeply economically intertwined.
But they're also competing for the same geopolitical space as leaders of the Global
South, and neither wants to play second fiddle.
According to diplomatic sources cited by CNN, one of the reasons Xi might have skipped Rio
was to avoid the awkwardness of bilateral meetings with Modi on neutral ground.
The board attentions from their 2020 clashes haven't really gone away.
They've just been papered over with diplomatic niceties.
And when your two biggest members can't even agree where their border is,
how are you supposed to present a united front against dollar hegemony?
And then there's the Russia problem.
Sure, Putin talks a big game about de-dollarization, but Russia's economy is heavily dependent on
energy exports and it's cut off from the Western financial system by sanctions.
They're selling oil to India at a massive discount and getting paid in rupees that
they can't really use very much.
But here's the thing.
As dysfunctional as BRICS is, they're responding to something real.
The dollar is a weapon, and everyone saw what happened when it was deployed against Russia
in 2022.
Whatever you think about the war in Ukraine, watching an entire G20 economy get financially
deleted overnight was sobering for non-Western countries.
One day Russia was integrated into global finance, the next day they were radioactive.
No due process, no appeal, just instant economic death penalty executed through
swift codes and banking regulations.
So China's been taking notes.
They know they're next on the menu.
So while they send polite diplomats to summits, they're rewiring their economy for survival.
That 95% yuan ruble trade with Russia?
That's not ideology.
That's preparation.
Even India trying to thread the needle between East and West gets it.
They'll swear they're not targeting the dollar while frantically setting up rupee
payment channels with anyone who'll take them.
When the game is rigged, you hedge your bets.
And for BRICS with all its messy politics, the biggest hedge is its proposed alternative
financial architecture.
Because although we didn't hear much fanfare about it in Rio, BRICS is still building.
The M-Bridge platformer, the CBDC project linking China, Thailand, UAE, and Hong Kong,
reached minimum viable product stage in mid-2024.
Interestingly, the Bank for International Settlements, which was helping develop M-Bridge,
suddenly handed over control of it to its partner central banks.
Funny how that happened right around the time people started seriously calling it a Swift
alternative.
Meanwhile, BRICS Pay is supposedly launching this year under Brazil's presidency.
They claim it can handle 20,000 messages per second, roughly 40 times Swift's current
capacity of about 518 per second.
Whether it actually works at scale is another question entirely.
Building a payment system is one thing, but getting banks to use it, achieving network
effects, navigating regulatory mazes, etc., etc., that's the real challenge.
But here's what's actually impressive.
About 90% of intra-BRICS trade is now settled in local currencies according to recent estimates.
And that's up from 65% just two years ago.
While politicians are playing diplomatic footsie, the actual plumbing of de-dollarization
is being installed trade by trade, deal by deal.
The numbers tell a story of slow but steady progress.
BRICS's share of global Swift payments has increased to 6.4%.
Their portion of cross-border bank settlement claims has risen to 15%.
The block now accounts for 40% of global GDP in purchasing power parity terms, compared
to 28% for the G7, though growing at 4% annually versus 3.3% for the global economy.
These aren't revolutionary changes that will overthrow the dollar tomorrow.
But piece by piece, BRICS is building a system where the dollar is no longer the only option
on the menu.
Now, the market reaction to all of this has been fascinating.
Goldman Sachs reports something that hasn't happened in decades.
U.S. Treasury bonds are selling off during periods of market stress instead of attracting
flight to quality flows.
For generations, when a crisis hit, money ran to U.S. Treasuries.
It was automatic.
Market crash?
Buy Treasuries.
Geopolitical crisis?
Buy Treasuries.
Your wife left you?
Buy Treasuries.
But now, it's not so automatic.
Trading volumes in the U.S. Treasury market hit 472.5 billion on a single day after one
of Trump's tariff announcements.
The 10-year yield spiked 49 basis points.
And this is a strong signal that even the safe haven status of U.S. debt isn't as safe
as it used to be.
And for crypto, this creates an interesting paradox.
You'd think that all of this talk of de-dollarization would be rocket fuel for Bitcoin.
Digital gold, hedge against fiat debasement, all that good stuff.
And long term, maybe it is.
But the elephant in our room is stablecoins.
97% of them are dollar pegged.
Tether alone has over 130 billion in circulation, all of it theoretically backed by dollar assets.
So even as countries try to escape the U.S. dollar system, the crypto market is accidentally
reinforcing it.
Every USDT transaction is, in a weird way, a vote of confidence in the greenback.
It's like trying to overthrow the king while wearing his face on your t-shirt.
The BRICS countries are starting to notice this contradiction.
At the Kazan summit last year, Russia and Iran were particularly vocal about developing
their own stablecoins.
But neither have a strong record when it comes to innovation in fintech.
China's got its digital yuan, but adoption has been front run by the Alipay and WeChat
Pay duopoly.
These private payment platforms are already deeply integrated into the lives of Chinese
consumers, giving the CBDC a steep hill to climb.
So where does this leave BRICS?
Well, they're caught between ambition and reality, between what they want to build and
what they can actually achieve given their international contradictions.
Take India's position.
External Affairs Minister S. J. Shankar made it crystal clear.
De-dollarization is, quote, not our policy or strategy.
India is happy to trade in rupees when it suits them, happy to buy Russian oil at a
discount, happy to accumulate gold.
But burning bridges with the US financial system?
That's not happening.
India's IT sector alone generates over $200 billion in revenue per year, mostly from
Western clients paying in dollars.
Their entire services export economy depends on seamless integration with Western financial
systems.
You think they're going to throw that away for some half-baked BRICS currency that might
never materialize?
Brazil's in a similar boat.
Lula talks a big game about multipolar this and global south that.
But Brazil's economy runs on commodity exports to China and manufactured imports from everywhere
else.
They need dollar funding markets.
They need American investment.
They need access to Western technology.
They can't afford to be locked out of the system.
Even China, for all its talk about de-risking from the dollar and building alternative systems,
still holds over $700 billion in US Treasury securities.
That's down from over a trillion a few years ago, but it's still a massive exposure to
the dollar system.
You don't dump three-quarters of a trillion dollars overnight unless you want to crater
the very assets you're trying to sell.
The new members aren't exactly profiles in courage either.
Saudi Arabia is recycling petrodollars and their currency is pegged to the greenback.
Egypt?
Dependent on American military aid.
Ethiopia?
Needs IMF bailouts.
Iran?
Using crypto to evade sanctions with results that charitably could be called mixed.
So Trump's threats are having their intended effect.
They're freezing BRICS in place.
100% tariffs are mutually assured economic destruction.
Which might be the point.
By threatening maximum violence upfront, Trump's trying to prevent any gradual erosion of dollar
dominance.
It's like holding a gun to everyone's head and saying nobody move or everyone gets hurt.
But here's the real problem with that strategy.
It might accelerate the very thing it's trying to prevent.
When you tell countries they'll face 100% tariffs for even thinking about alternatives
to the dollar, you create a massive incentive to find those alternatives before you can pull
the trigger.
We're already seeing this play out.
Despite Trump's threats, or maybe because of them, BRICS central banks bought more gold
in 2024 than any year on record.
China's been systematically reducing its treasury holdings.
Russia and Iran are trading oil in yuan and rupees.
Saudi Arabia is accepting yuan for oil sales to China.
Small moves individually, but they add up.
So what's emerging isn't some coordinated BRICS resistance movement, but a ragtag band of
countries finding their own ways to reduce dollar dependence while avoiding direct confrontation
with Washington.
It's death for the dollar by a thousand cuts rather than a full frontal assault.
The crypto angle is particularly chaotic.
Russia can't decide if it loves or hates Bitcoin.
One day they're banning it, the next day they're using it for international settlements.
China bans mining, but Chinese miners keep popping up like whack-a-mole.
The UAE wants to be a crypto hub while maintaining dollar pegs.
Iran uses crypto to evade sanctions while imposing crypto curfews on the public.
There's no unified BRICS crypto strategy, just improvisation and experimentation,
which might actually be more dangerous for dollar hegemony than a coordinated assault.
It's harder to fight a hundred different workarounds than one big alternative.
Xi's absence from Rio symbolizes the deeper problem, however.
How do you build an alternative to Western hegemony when your biggest members can barely
stand to be in the same room together?
Trump's betting that these divisions are insurmountable and that by applying
maximum pressure now, he can keep BRICS fragmented and defensive indefinitely.
And right now, it's working.
The bloc is more focused on avoiding American retaliation than building their promised
New World Order.
But here's what history teaches us about empires and their currencies.
They don't last forever.
The British pound dominated global trade for over a century until it didn't.
Before that, it was the Spanish Rial, the Dutch Gilder, the Byzantine Solidus.
All of them seemed permanent until suddenly they weren't.
The dollar has had an incredible run, 80 years as the world's reserve currency.
But that dominance was built on specific circumstance.
The United States' military empire, deep and liquid financial markets, strong rule
of law, and most importantly, the absence of viable alternatives.
But those circumstances are changing.
American power is more contested than it's been since World War II.
Financial markets are digesting in ways that produce US control.
And alternatives, however flawed and fragmented, are being built.
For crypto, this is the macro context that really matters.
We're witnessing the slow-motion transformation of the global financial system.
It's not happening as fast as the Bitcoin maxis predicted or as smoothly as the BRICS
leaders hoped.
But it's happening nonetheless.
The opportunity is obvious.
As trust in fiat currencies erodes and countries look for neutral alternatives,
Bitcoin and crypto could benefit massively.
We already see this in countries under sanctions, where crypto provides a lifeline to global
markets.
Every sanctions regime, every tariff threat, every frozen bank account creates another
crypto convert.
But the warning is equally important.
The empire strikes back.
Always.
If crypto truly threatens dollar dominance, expect the response to make Trump's current
tariff threats look like a gentle suggestion.
What BRICS shows us is just how hard it is to change the global financial system.
Even with regime grievances, massive economic power, and clear motivation, they're struggling
to build functioning alternatives.
The network effects of the current system are that powerful.
But impossible things happen all the time in finance.
Nobody thought the gold standard would end until Nixon killed it in 1975.
Nobody thought negative interest rates were possible until Europe and Japan made them
a reality.
Few thought a single Bitcoin would be worth $100,000 until it happened.
And if you want to find out just how high Bitcoin could go this cycle, why not check

This is me, Nick, signing off.
Thank you guys very much for watching, and I'll see you again soon.
