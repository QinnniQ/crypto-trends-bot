I think that we are at the precipice of a major shift in terms of how cross-border payments work.
China has by far the biggest and most advanced state-backed project to do this through both the
ECNY as well as Enbridge, this platform that they built with other central banks.
And so the question is, can the U.S. retain its lead?
Welcome to Bankless, where today we explore the frontier of economic sanctions and internet money.
An interesting combination. This is Ryan Sean Adams. I'm here to help you become
more bankless. I've always wanted to do a deep dive in this somewhat nerdy topic.
This is America's superpower of economic sanctions. And our guest today, Edward
Fishman, provides a crash course on this. Make no mistake, this is very much a crypto topic
because the power of the U.S. to sanction comes from the dominance of the dollar.
This is a topic we often discuss on Bankless. And not only the dominance of the dollar,
but the dominance of the U.S. banking system. Ninety percent of all transactions are settled
in the dollar today. But in the future, Edward thinks countries will have more than one option.
They can either stay in the U.S. system, they can move to the new Chinese digital currency,
or, and this is the most interesting, they can set up shop in crypto, the internet money system.
Few things we discuss. Why sanctions are more powerful than tanks and missiles.
The 2015 Iran sanctions. What it feels like to be cut off from the dollar.
The 2022 Russia sanctions. How Ed found himself on Russia's sanction list.
The effectiveness of sanctions. U.S. dollar supremacy. Stable coins as America's best hope.
And whether Ed thinks crypto is a tool to evade sanctions or a tool for economic freedom.

Bankless Station, very excited to introduce our next guest. Edward Fishman is a senior
research scholar at Columbia University. And before that, he spent about a decade in government
designing sanctions on Iran, Russia, Europe. He knows a thing or two about economic sanctions
and our topic today, choke points. In fact, he wrote a book called Choke Points, American
Power in the Age of Economic Warfare. Ed, welcome to Bankless.
It's great to be here with you today, Ryan. Thanks for having me on the show.
Okay. So this is primarily a crypto podcast, but we cover all sorts of things related to
the economy and monetary policy. And I think what we want to do, Eddie, if this is okay,
is get a crash course from you on financial sanctions, what you call choke points.
And maybe the way to start this is just to ask the question,
how does America currently project its power through sanctions today?
Sure. And I appreciate that question because I think really my main motivation in writing my
book Choke Points is we hear about sanctions all the time. They're front page news almost every
single day. And very few people could even answer what they are. Maybe to zoom out for a second,
economic warfare itself is as old as history. From the beginning of recorded history, states
have tried to advance their objectives internationally by applying economic pressure
on other countries, on other states. Historically speaking, though, up until very recently,
doing that in any meaningful way really required the use of military force.
So for instance, as recently as the 1990s, the most prominent case of economic sanctions that
happens in the 1990s is when the US and the United Nations impose an embargo on Saddam
Hussein's Iraq. This is right after Iraq invades Kuwait, the neighboring state, and annexes it in
1990. That's ultimately what precipitated the Gulf War. And the goal of the sanctions that were put
in place and the UN imposed a full embargo on Iraq within 48 hours of Saddam's invasion of 1990
was to stop Iraq from selling oil on international markets. And this embargo stayed in place all the
way from 1990 to 2003 up until George W. Bush launched the even bigger second invasion of Iraq.
And the way that that was implemented, the way that the US and its partners actually set about
stopping Iraq from selling oil was through a multinational naval blockade. It was by having
naval ships patrol the Persian Gulf 24-7 for that entire 13-year period. And whenever they saw a
ship or tanker going in and out of Iraqi ports, and they were suspicious that this might be
in contravention of the embargo, they would actually dispatch commandos via helicopter
to land on the ship. And if they found oil on board, to take samples and send it to
laboratories for testing. So as recently as the 1990s, really hard-hitting economic warfare
required naval force. If you were a trading power, sometimes even sieges. You go back
throughout history, it's surrounding a city and stopping anything from coming in and out.
But what happened in the wake of the 1990s, in the wake of what we now call hyper-globalization,
when you really globalize the international financial system, when countries like China
and Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union that had previously been outside of the dollar
system, come into the dollar-based financial system, when they start using international
supply chains, we see the creation of these choke points in the global economy, these parts
of the global economy where one state has a dominant position, and there are few, if any,
substitutes. And this is key, the non-substitutability. The most important of those is the dollar,
just given its incredibly central role in international finance. 90% of all foreign
exchange transactions have the dollar on one side or the other, and there's $7 trillion worth of
foreign exchange transactions changing hands every single day. So just the scale is almost beyond
our comprehension. And the way that the US has come to weaponize these choke points, and we can
talk about this through the course of the episode, most importantly of all is through that financial
choke point. It is through now not necessarily putting a ship outside of Iran's ports. That's
not how the US stopped Iran from selling oil. It was by going to banks in places like China and
India and Turkey, all of which were importing Iranian oil, and said, if you were processing
payments for Iranian oil, you have to comply with our policy or we're going to cut you off from the
dollar. Basically giving a binary choice and being able to weaponize that choke point of the dollar
based system. What we have today is a system where the US government can impose really devastating
economic harm on any other foreign country without deploying a single US soldier or sailor into
harm's way. That's fascinating. There's so many questions that branch from this topic. And I guess
what you're saying is the concept of economic sanctions and the tool of warfare of economic
sanctions, that's not new. That's been with us throughout history. But the means to deploy that
digitally rather than to use the nation state level monopoly on violence and actually deploy
troops and force the issue in meat space, or now we could do it digitally rather than meat space,
and that part is all new. I'm wondering if you could give us some history here. On Banklist,
we're like suckers for just some good stories throughout history. I know your book talks about
series like the history of economic sanctions, early days, Greek city states, that kind of thing.
How were these sanctions in the ancient world used and are there stories throughout history
that show us the power of these things? Yeah. If you look at how the Iraq embargo
worked that I just mentioned, naval patrols, that really is what economic warfare even looked
like going back to ancient Greece. The most prominent case of economic warfare in the ancient
world is Athens on the precipice of what became the Peloponnesian War, this 27 year struggle
between Athens and Sparta, imposes an embargo on its neighboring city state of Megara, basically
to try to send us a signal to Sparta about its economic power. And the way that Athens actually
cut off Megara from trade was through its naval dominance. At the time, Athens had a naval empire,
so they controlled all of the naval city states around the ancient Aegean, and they had by far
the biggest navy in the ancient Mediterranean. And so they were able basically to cripple
Megara's economy with a naval embargo that looked very similar to the Iraq embargo of the 1990s.
The way that we moved from that old style of economic warfare really comes about by accident.
I think that's why choke points for some people say it can be very exciting to see how the story
unfolds because it wasn't necessarily brilliant people sitting behind a room being like, oh,
well, we can do this incredible new strategy. It was like a series of discoveries. And the first
really comes after George W. Bush is reelected. So just to reposition our listeners, what was
happening at the end of 2004? This is right when George W. Bush wins his second term over John Kerry.
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are well underway. The casus belli for the US invasion of Iraq,
which had been that Saddam Hussein was building weapons of mass destruction and principally
nuclear weapons by then had already been proven to be false, that Iraq did not have any meaningful
weapons of mass destruction. And yet at the same time that that discovery came to be confirmed in
late 2004, Iran, which is right next to Iraq and much bigger and more powerful than Iraq,
actually was building a significant industrial scale nuclear enrichment program. And so you had
this really awkward situation for George W. Bush, which he had literally just invaded a foreign
country and overthrew their ruler to try to get rid of a nuclear program that didn't exist.
And yet the neighboring country actually was developing legitimate nuclear program.
And there was no appetite for yet another war in the Middle East. The US was already fighting
two at the same time. And so there was a question like, what do we do about this? How do we stop
this really clear and present danger? And especially because Iran, if you think about it,
was also supporting terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. And there's real concern that
if Iran had fissile material, nuclear material, they could give it to a terrorist group that could
then launch an attack that was an order of magnitude worse than 9-11. And people, there's
actually this great press conference I recall in my book Choke Point in December of 2004,
after Bush is reelected, where a reporter asks him, well, why don't we try to do sanctions on
Iran? And he says, well, we've sanctioned ourselves out of influence with Iran. We don't have any
influence over Iran anymore. And his logic was that the US had already imposed a domestic embargo
on Iran. The US wasn't trading anything with Iran. You couldn't buy anything from Iran. If you were
an American individual or a company, you couldn't sell anything to Iran. And there was no appetite
for this kind of naval embargo style, more aggressive sanctions that you would imply,
because that was seen as sort of like on the same spectrum as military force. That could have been
ultimately a segue to a war with Iran that no one wanted. And so he kind of used sanctions as
not important, almost feckless. And when he said this, the official in his government,
this guy named Stuart Levy, who actually winds up playing a really important role in the history of
crypto too that we could talk about, he's at the time serving as the first undersecretary of the
Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. So the official who oversees US sanctions. And he
hears Bush say this, and he views it as like a personal challenge. He's like, the president has
just said that I have no role to play in the top most national security priority. I really need to
figure this out. And Stuart, he's a brilliant lawyer. He's a soft-spoken guy, but he's got a
chip on his shoulder. And so a few months later, he's actually in a hotel room, or sorry, he's at a
hotel restaurant in Bahrain, in the Gulf, in the Persian Gulf, flipping through the Financial Times
when he comes across an article about a Swiss bank that of its own volition has cut ties with Iran.
Basically just decided didn't want to do business with Iran anymore. And he kind of has this light
bulb moment at the time where he says, hold on, maybe it's okay if we can't persuade China and
Russia and the UK and France and Germany to cut ties with Iran, the governments. Maybe it's okay
if we don't send a naval blockade into the Persian Gulf. Maybe I can just go around to
the financial centers of the world, meet with bankers in London and Frankfurt and Dubai and
Hong Kong and Singapore, bring with me declassified intelligence showing them how Iran was using their
banks, often unwittingly, to funnel money into its nuclear program and to support terrorist
proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah and persuade nine out of 10 of them of their own volition to stop
doing business with Iran. Because they didn't want a front page article saying that HSBC
is involved in funding Iran's nuclear program. And so he kind of sets this new paradigm of
government to business diplomacy where he goes around and within a couple of years,
pretty well isolates Iran from the international financial system, persuades
most of the biggest banks in the world to quit Iran of their own volition.
So before Stuart Levy, we didn't do this. The US didn't do this. They didn't impose sanctions in
I don't know if I call it self-power type way, but it just without any physical force, right?
Using kind of networks of banks and softer sort of, I guess, a digital touch to all of this.
We didn't do this before Stuart Levy. That's right. Exactly. We thought of sanctions as
basically just another sort of way station on the way to actual military force, right? You needed
the UN to authorize them and then you send an embargo if you're serious. You send a naval
blockade if you're serious. And that's what's interesting is sometimes in many cases like
these sanctions, the type of economic sanctions you were talking about previously that nations
did to one another was a precursor to war, wasn't it? I mean, it was the entry point into war. It
was almost verging on a declaration of war. Yes, 100%. I think this is the important thing
when you think about it from a mental standpoint is if you were prepared to go for hard-hitting
economic warfare, which involved oftentimes the interdiction of cargo, right? Literally
inspecting ships coming in and out of a port. The way for a foreign government to stop that from
happening is to physically fire on your ships, sink your ships, right? With torpedoes or missiles,
right? You could go back to the naval blockades that occurred during World War I and World War II
where a lot of the naval wars were all about making economic warfare possible on the part
of the allies or to break blockades on behalf of Germany and its allies. So it was seen as
a way station to war, something that precipitated war. The advent of this new style of economic
warfare where you're not using anything besides effectively the self-interest of the private
sector. Banks deciding either that they don't want the reputational harm of being seen to be
doing business with Iran or for those who are stragglers, like I said, it's nine out of 10,
not 10 out of 10 who care about their reputation. For that one out of 10, you can go and say,
okay, well, if you keep doing business with Iran, you're cut off from the U.S. dollar.
Yeah. Ray Dalio talks a little bit about the trap, the Thucydides trap that nations often find
themselves in. He talks about the precursor to hot wars are often economic sanction wars. I recall
him going through the scenario of Japan, 1930s in the U.S. I don't recall the specific legislation,
but the U.S., as I recall, basically blocked Japan off sanction, economically sanctioned them,
cut off their entire supply of oil in the Pacific Islands and that entire region.
This was, according to historians, a key reason that Japan felt the need to surprise attack
and launch Pearl Harbor. His point being the economic sanction attack is often a precursor
to war. It's almost an act of war in itself, and it can get nations into hot war scenarios rather
quickly. Yeah, that's 100% right. Funnily enough, about a month ago, Ray Dalio and I spoke at the
same conference and backstage, we had this conversation. He was saying, because I gave
him a copy of choke points, he gave me a copy of his new book. He was like, yeah, it's all about
economic warfare. We had this exact conversation. It's true. The Pearl Harbor attacks of Japan on
the United States were precipitated by a very aggressive American embargo of Japan.
I do think that we should not be using economic warfare willy-nilly. What I will say, though,
at the same time is that because of the way that we are prosecuting economic warfare today,
where it is much more economic warfare by paper. The main characters in my book are not generals
and admirals. They're bankers, they're lawyers, they're government bureaucrats that are actually
prosecuting this economic warfare. It is a little bit less risky today, but we ought not
underestimate the risks when we go ahead with these weapons.
Who makes these decisions? Where does this reside in the US government? To your point,
it's not in the Pentagon, it's not in traditional military, yet these are economic attacks of a
sort. Who's calling the shots for these? Who decides? It strikes me that this is definitely
not an act of Congress. Does the president essentially sign off on all of these economic
sanctions? Yeah. Economic warfare is interesting relative to military force in that the president
does have tremendous power with respect to economic warfare. It's actually what's being
tested right now in some of the court cases around Trump's tariffs because there's a 1977 law
called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to declare a
national emergency and then effectively cut off any foreign individual or company from the US
economy, whether the financial system or imports from the United States. It gives the US president
a lot of power. For instance, the Russia sanctions of 2022, where the US government did everything
from embargo Russian oil to impose financial sanctions on the biggest banks in Russia. They
froze the sovereign reserves of the central bank of Russia. All of that was done by President Biden
with the stroke of a pen, just with executive authority. That was not Congress. The thing that
is interesting is that Congress also can impose sanctions. Congress can pass laws that have the
same force. They can basically tell the president, you must impose sanctions on this foreign company
or foreign individual. What that means is there are two different actors. One of the interesting
parts of the story of Iran sanctions leading up to the nuclear deal in 2015. Those are probably
the most impactful US sanctions in modern times. It starts during this Stuart Levy period,
mostly through executive action, where it's really the Bush administration is passing executive
orders. It's Levy who's honestly pioneering the policy out of the Treasury Department.
But then as we get into the Obama administration, and Obama famously wants to reach out a hand to
Iran and try to do diplomacy, Congress really loses confidence in Obama's strategy and starts
passing really aggressive sanctions over the head of the Obama administration with oftentimes like
100 to zero in the Senate. When you pass something with that kind of a majority,
it's veto proof. If the president vetoes it, Congress can then just override its veto by
passing the law with a two thirds majority. Look, I was involved in sanctions at the time,
working at both Treasury and State. The thing that was interesting, I actually had to implement
some of these sanctions. I was the guy who had to go to places like Singapore and Vietnam and
Malaysia and talk to shipping companies and oil companies and tell them, if you keep processing
payments for Iranian oil, you're going to be cut off from the dollar. I was the person who was sent
out to do those conversations. It actually was very helpful to me because it's an awkward
conversation to say, I don't want to be in this room, but Congress just passed a bill unanimously.
I really don't want to be here. That makes it much easier because it's like, you're not the bad guy.
You're just the guy delivering the news. You're trying to help them. You're trying to help them
avoid this catastrophic consequence of being cut off from the dollar. In some ways, even though
we kind of hated it at the time that Congress was breathing down our neck in the Obama administration,
it winds up being absolutely critical to tighten the screws on Iran.
That's the stick that the US has, being cut off from the dollar. That sounds terrible, I suppose.
Could you get into the nuts and bolts of what that actually means? What does that mean for a
country that's on the receiving end of this or a group of individuals? Iran in 2015, cut off from
the dollar. In what ways were they cut off? What was the effect on their government,
the people in power? How did they feel it? Yeah. I'm really glad you asked this because I think
even within the national security community, even people sitting around the table in the
Situation Room may not fully understand or grasp. Well, they've never been cut off from the dollar,
right? They've always had access to it. Exactly. I now have a bit of a taste in this
because I was sanctioned by Russia in 2022. Not having access to the ruble, it's not quite
the same, but I have similar stories. Wow. We've got to get into that story, too.
Yeah. Okay. But first, what does it feel like to get cut off from the dollar?
Sure. Let's just talk about why the dollar is so important for a second. Oftentimes,
it's kind of thrown around that the dollar is the world reserve currency, which is true.
Central banks hold 60% roughly of their sovereign reserves, their foreign exchange reserves in
dollars and dollar-based assets. Treasuries, primarily?
Exactly. However, when people really say the dollar is the global reserve currency,
it's usually what they're trying to say is the dollar is the dominant currency across
all use cases for currency. The use cases, as probably your listeners know, it's not just
being a store of value. It's also a medium of exchange and unit of account.
Yes. When you look at medium of exchange,
I mentioned earlier, the dollar is involved in 90% of foreign exchange transactions.
That's a staggering number, 90% of all foreign exchange transactions. Does that mean effectively
90% of all purchasing activity across the world happens in the dollar?
Yeah. Look, there are some foreign exchange transactions that are happening because of
speculation and whatnot. But I do think it is probably the most illustrative statistic of the
importance of the dollar because it encapsulates everything. Because anytime two countries are
trading with each other, there is going to be at least one, if not multiple foreign exchange
transactions that happen. Because a good example, let's say India is selling rice to Saudi Arabia.
A Saudi bank isn't going to hold rupees. It doesn't make sense for a Saudi bank to hold
every currency that they may encounter. They'll have Saudi reals because they've got customers
in Saudi Arabia who deposit their reals in the bank. And then they also have dollars.
And they have those dollars through this correspondent bank network here in New York
City, usually through a relationship with an American bank. And so the way that that
transaction would actually happen behind the hood is that the reals would be converted into dollars
and the dollars would be converted into rupees to pay the Indian supplier for the rice. So that the
Indian supplier could then go to the rice farmers and pay them their salary in rupees. So the dollar
is going to basically be serving as a way station to make this transaction possible, even though
there's no U.S. company that's clearly involved in the transaction. And that's what makes U.S.
sanctions really so powerful that you can interdict trade between countries that have nothing to do
with the United States just because they need access to the foreign exchange market to actually
make that payment possible. This is also why stablecoin and crypto potentially could be
a paradigm shift for how the system works. I'm sure we'll get into that later.
But beyond just also being the default medium of exchange, the dollar is the default
store value. Beyond the central bank reserves, it's something like 70, 80 percent of equity
market capitalization is in dollars. Ditto with debt markets. I mean, everything. Basically,
if you have money right now, most of the time you want to invest it in dollar assets.
We may be at sort of the end of that story now or the very beginning of the end, but
so far that is how things have been. And then also when you think about unit of account,
which is just how are you invoicing international trade? What is the currency that you're listing
prices at? The dollar is by far the dominant unit of account. And most importantly, in key
commodities markets like oil, where the global price of oil is quoted in dollars, oil contracts
generally are in dollars. And if you just think about the scale of the oil market, just how massive
it is, 100 million barrels of oil a day. I mean, it's just an incredible scale of money changing
hands every single day. And, you know, the fact that oil is priced in dollars is something I talk
about in choke points actually winds up becoming a sort of key linchpin of the entire dollar system
when that deal is struck between the US and Saudi Arabia in the 1970s.
So for Iran getting cut off from the dollar, what does that feel like?
Got it. Yeah. And I appreciate you re-centering me on the key question. So what does that mean?
So for an Iranian company, it means that it's really challenging to do any business outside
of Iran because you are not able to basically make foreign exchange transactions. So how do you clear
payment? Even if you have a good that you want to sell to Europe or China or vice versa, how are you
actually settling that payment? What is the medium of exchange, right? Iran, by the way, when it was
cut off from the dollar and still to this day, they use a lot of methods that we would consider
absolutely insane, right? It's like barter, right? Where they're trading lentils in exchange for
rice or something like that, which is extremely hard and cumbersome to do. They use gold sometimes
for certain transactions. The reason, though, it becomes even harder for Iran is that you have
what's called secondary sanctions where let's say even if Iran can decide, you know what,
we're going to just use the euro to trade with Europe, right? The US can say, well, if you
transact with an Iranian company under sanctions, you will then be cut off from the dollar.
You European bank, if you are processing payment with Iran, we're going to cut you off from the
dollar. And then the European bank has to decide, well, do I care more about access to the dollar
or do I care about facilitating this trade with Iran? And so to go back to the example
of oil sanctions, right? I mentioned the oil embargo on Iraq in the 1990s, US naval sailors
inspecting cargoes. The way that the Iran oil sanctions work, which were even more impactful,
they cut Iran's oil sales by over 60%. What they did was it was going around to refineries in places
like China, India, Turkey, and their banks importantly, and saying, if you do not reduce
your purchases of oil from Iran every six months, basically, if you don't gradually wind down your
purchases from Iran, you will lose access to the dollar. And so in some ways, it's not even the
sanctions that are directly on Iran that are the most impactful. It's being able to pressure Iran's
trading partners. Finally, what does that all lead to, right? What it leads to is a country that
is not only effectively severed from international trade, but it also generally means that you wind
up having things like substantial inflation. And so the purchasing power of the population goes
down. You see living standards go down. You wind up seeing your currency depreciate substantially
because there's effectively very little demand for your goods because people don't want to trade
with you. And so it does wind up having broad-based economic effects on the entire country.
And so one of, I think, the biggest myths about sanctions that you hear policymakers say is,
oh, well, these sanctions are narrowly targeted at the leadership. They're affecting Ayatollah
Khomeini or they're affecting Putin. I mean, it is very, very hard to impoverish poop, right?
I don't think you could do that. We're powerful in the U.S., but we're not that powerful, right?
But so what generally happens is the brunt of these sanctions is really felt by everyday people.
And I think what that means, if you're a U.S. government official who's prosecuting economic
war, you have to have a damn good reason for doing this, right? You shouldn't do this lightly,
right? Because there are negative externalities. You're making people's lives worse. You're
generating people who don't like the United States, right? So you have to have a good reason.
With Iran, I think we did have quite a good reason, which was we were trying
to get a peaceful resolution to Iran's nuclear program. We were trying to end Iran's nuclear
program without risking a war. And I think the Obama administration ultimately succeeded with that.
I think with Russia, the goal was to initially deter Putin from invading Ukraine. That failed.
But I think ultimately after that, it's about weakening Russia. It's about making Russia
less able to deploy its military in ways that are bad for not only Ukrainians, but the entire
international community. And I think those are warranted. But I think in some of these other
more edge cases of should we be using sanctions or not, you should be default to not using them.
So use of economic sanctions on a country by the US is absolutely going to have
large impacts on their economy in a negative way. So I'm sure this impacts GDP. This can increase
inflation. You're saying that the citizens of the country generally are the ones paying for this,
but this does have a cost. This does have an economic cost to the country that the US is,
I guess I could use the word, attacking in this way.
Can we talk a bit more about the more recent sanctions on Russia? So there are other things
like cutting them off from the payment network, of course. Maybe you could talk a little bit about
the tools that are employed here, the sanction stack as it were, because it was surprising,
I think, to a lot of folks that the US had the ability to just freeze bank accounts of Russian
oligarchs, effectively seize their assets, take their money. And a lot of US politicians
were talking about this. So what were the effects in the US-Russia sanctions on Russian oligarchs?
And mechanically, how did this even work? Sure. Yeah. So I think it's helpful to go back to
the circumstances of February, 2022, when the big Russia sanctions went into effect right after
the big invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration and the rest of America's
allies and the G7 had fundamentally a problem, which was they needed to maximize the economic
pain on Russia to try to accelerate a change of heart about his war in Ukraine. But they had to
do so in a way that didn't have catastrophic consequences at home for us. In the US, the way
that that manifested was we already had oil prices over $100 a barrel in 2022. Inflation was at a
four decade high. It was over 7% at the time. And so the Biden administration was really nervous
about targeting the key export from Russia, which is oil. And so in and of itself, it was a really
hard problem to maximize pressure on a country like Russia without targeting their main export.
So what the US and the rest of the G7 did was they focused on finance and technology.
We imposed blocking sanctions on the biggest banks in Russia, Spare Bank and BTB,
which fully cut them off from access to the dollar based system. We also kicked a number of the big
Russian banks out of Swift, which is this financial messaging service based in Belgium. The thing
that's interesting about Swift that people talk about is you say, oh, this is a huge sanction that
the US can deploy. Well, actually, Swift is based in Belgium. It's a European Union entity. And so
it was actually the EU that kicked Russian banks out of Swift. It wasn't the US. The US, of course,
has quite a bit of leverage over Europe and so can pressure Europe to take that action. It can also
deploy pressure directly on Swift, which it has done in the past. But in this case, it was actually
the EU that kicked the Russian banks out of Swift. And then I think the most important sanction of
them all was sanctions on the Central Bank of Russia. So between 2014, when Russia first invaded
Ukraine and Axis Crimea and the US put sanctions on Russia, and 2022, the Central Bank of Russia
and other economic technocrats in Moscow tried to sanction the truth for Russia's economy,
basically to try to harden themselves for what they thought was going to be a new economic attack.
And the main way that they did this was through accumulating $630 billion worth of sovereign
reserves. Basically, they thought if they have this giant stockpile of hard currency,
even if their banks are cut off from the dollar and the euro, they ultimately can
defend the ruble, make sure that it doesn't absolutely collapse. They can buy critical
imports for a long enough time that the crisis will blow over and basically the West will
eventually come around. And these sovereign reserves, what were they denominated in? Were
these US treasuries in bonds of other foreign currencies or this is harder assets like gold
or something like this? It's a really important question. So I mentioned earlier, 60% of sovereign
reserves globally are dollars, right? Russia really looked like a normal allocation up until
2018. And in April of 2018, under pressure from Congress, Donald Trump during his first presidency
imposed unilateral sanctions on a Russian aluminum company called Rusol, which wound up really
stoking chaos in aluminum markets. The company's stock was cut in half and Trump ultimately pulled
the sanctions back within like 24 hours. But the lesson that Putin and his team took from that was
if the West one day goes on an economic offensive against Russia, it's only going to be the US
acting alone. The Europeans aren't going to follow suit. And so what they did after this action in
2018 was they actually dumped a lot of their treasuries, over $100 billion worth of treasuries
and reallocated primarily to the Euro. And so by the time the war starts in 2022,
of those 630 billion of sovereign reserves, something like 250 billion are in the Euro,
which is kind of remarkable. You had another 50 billion, give or take, distributed between
the dollar, yen and pound. And then the rest of it was gold and RMB. And so Russia had this sort of
untraditional reserve allocation where the biggest part of their reserves was euros.
And after that was really sort of gold, RMB in dollars. After that, they also, interestingly
enough, beyond even their reserves, they started using the Euro as their key medium of exchange.
So between 2018 and 2022, Russia was clearing its cross border payments in euros. Like when
China and Russia were doing trade, if China was buying oil or gas from Russia, they were paying
Russia in euros. And that bet ultimately proves catastrophic because one of the upsides, I think,
of Joe Biden's penchant for multilateralism and working with allies was it wasn't just the US and
imposed sanctions on the central bank of Russia, it was also Europe. And so to this day, we have
something like $250 billion worth of Russian foreign exchange reserves sitting in European
bank accounts. They're denominated in euros. Just frozen. Russia cannot access. Okay, so
the sanctions against Russia's central bank, you said, were the most impactful, maybe the most
devastating. So basically all of those foreign reserves that Russia had been hoarding, some
treasuries, but now mainly diversified into Euro-backed bonds, they were in the stroke of
a pen or kind of the, I don't know if it's the stroke of the pen or something in some computer
system, suddenly frozen one day. And so Russia has no, Russia's central bank has no access to
any of those reserves. Yes. And to add insult to entry to the Russians. So these reserves actually,
a big part of them is kind of interesting. It's like 200 billion euros that are actually in one
institution called Euroclear, which is a Belgian institution. And what has been happening now for
the last, since the end of 2024 or so late in the Biden administration is that the US and Europe
have been using the proceeds from those frozen assets, basically the interest that it's throwing
off to finance aid for Ukraine. Wow. And so a $50 billion loan that was basically given to Ukraine
is being financed, being repaid through the interest proceeds from Russia's sovereign assets.
All of that money is being used to buy weapons for Ukraine, ultimately to fight and kill Russians.
So how painful is that for Russia when they get, I don't know in terms of what percent of their
central bank reserves this was actually, about half was frozen? Yeah. Oh my God. Okay. So
what does this do to the local currency and basically their monetary policy? It crushes,
I mean, if you go, I mean, this is the thing that's interesting too, is now people say,
oh, well look, Russia's weathered the storm. I mean, go back to March of 2022.
For a full month, the Russian stock market was closed, completely shut down. You couldn't trade
anything in Russia. The ruble collapsed to something like 135 rubles to the dollar, which
was by far the lowest it's ever been. And you wind up having, I mean, effectively what happens in that
scenario, if your currency is completely collapsing, normally what happens is a central
bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to try to prop up the value of the currency.
So let's say Russia had access to its dollars and euros. Sure. It would take dollars and euros,
go on foreign exchange reserves and buy rubles. And what that would do is it would create demand
for rubles that then would kind of check some of the demand on the other side of the transaction.
It's the purpose of having these reserve assets. Exactly. Because if you think about the other
side of the transaction, it's all these individual Russians who are saying, I don't trust my currency.
I want to have dollars. They're taking their rubles and converting them into dollars and
euros, as well as foreign investors who are pulling money out of the country.
And so that is why you have foreign reserves. They couldn't do that because all of them are frozen.
What the Russian government did though, actually was quite clever. And what is effectively
exploiting one of the gaps in the Western sanctions is they told all of the state-owned
enterprises in Russia, critically, like Rosneft and Gazprom. Rosneft is the state-owned oil company.
Gazprom is the state-owned gas company. Remember, I got over telling you that the US did not want
to affect the sales of Russian fossil fuels because they're worried about spiking oil prices
and worsening inflation in the United States. They forced the Rosnefts of the world to sell
80% of the dollars that they were accumulating for rubles. And so effectively, they took the
balance sheets of state-owned enterprises and leveraged them to intervene in foreign exchange
markets on behalf of the Russian government. And this, by the way, in retrospect, was the key error,
I think, that the sanctions made, was they didn't realize that Russia could do this and they didn't
act quickly enough. Because theoretically, you could have said, okay, we'll frozen those assets too.
Totally. You could have said, well, Rosneft is cut off from the dollar. And so all state-owned
enterprises in Russia are cut off from the US financial system, but they didn't do that.
It was just focused on the central bank as well as the big commercial banks like Spare Bank and
VTB. And that winds up being, I think, a really important gap in the sanctions. And it's what
allows Russia not to fully recover, but basically to avoid a catastrophic financial meltdown.
Right. And some bad weeks, days and weeks, I imagine for Russian oligarchs as well,
who received similar treatment, right? Did the US effectively find their bank accounts wherever
they were located internationally and freeze those assets as well?
Yeah. So with the Russian oligarchs, I'm always hesitant to be like bad weeks,
because these guys, maybe their net worth- They're doing okay.
Yeah. Their net worth maybe went down from 10 billion to 2 billion, but they're not living
on the street. And look, I also want to be in some way empathetic in that a lot of them did
have to change their lifestyles. A lot of them were spending time in New York and London and
owned properties on the Mediterranean. And now they spend more time in Moscow and St. Petersburg
and on the Black Sea and their dacha instead of in the Mediterranean. But yes, a lot of these
Russian oligarchs, if you think about any state where you don't trust property rights,
you don't trust that the government isn't just going to come and take your money,
which is the reality in Russia, right? I mean, the way Putin really consolidates his power in
the early 2000s was he gathers around the oligarchs and says, if you don't stay out of politics,
I'm going to take your money. And this one guy, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who's the most powerful
oligarch at the time, oil kingpin, he doesn't listen. And Putin not only expropriates his oil
company, which then becomes part of the state owned oil company, Rosneft, but actually throws
him in prison. So yes, in countries where you don't trust that the government's going to respect
your property rights, a lot of people offshore their wealth, right? That's why Russian oligarchs
have these giant properties in London and Miami and New York, and why many of them had giant
bank accounts denominated in dollars and euros. A lot of them were frozen. Their yachts, in many
cases, were seized. And so yes, the sanctions did affect their lifestyles to a certain extent,
but most of them wind up going back to Russia and doing okay.
So these sanctions of 2022 against Russia, are these sort of the largest sanctions that
we've seen so far and kind of the biggest targets? I mean, I know there's been sanctions,
you know, with Korea, we talked about Iran 2015, but Russia is, I don't know, order of magnitude,
more sophisticated, and are the sanctions that level of more devastating and more aggressive
versus other cases? Yeah. So the sanctions on Russia are not as comprehensive as the Iran sanctions.
So I mentioned earlier, you know, with Iran, we're going around to buyers of Iranian oil and telling
them if they don't listen to us, if they don't, I mean, maybe I'll just do one quick tangent,
because I think it's quite remarkable. The most impactful sanctions on Iran and the ones that
actually give the Obama administration the leverage to cut the nuclear deal, was eventually we went
around to banks in China, India, Turkey, and said, you can pay Iran for their oil, but you can only
pay into a central bank of Iran account, domiciled in your home country, and you can only allow those
proceeds to be used to finance bilateral trade. So, you know, if China was buying oil from Iran,
they'd pay an Iranian account in China, and the money could only be used to buy, you know,
refrigerators from China, it couldn't be, they couldn't, you know, bring it to Lebanon to finance
Hezbollah, they couldn't buy nuclear equipment with it. And within two years of this policy going
into effect, there are 10s of billions of dollars of Iran's own money sitting in these offshore
accounts that Iran basically can only access for very limited purposes. And the way we got the
nuclear deals, we told Iran, we will give you unfettered access to your own money in exchange
for you getting rid of your nuclear program. And that was enough. That like that was enough.
Wow.
So we did, the sanctions on Iran are much, much more comprehensive than the ones against Russia.
Because the US had much more leverage over that scenario than Russia.
I think we could have been tougher, frankly, on Russia. I think it's because Russia is so
much bigger, as you said. In particular, they're such a large exporter of fossil fuels, so seven
and a half million barrels of crude oil plus petroleum products each day. We were more
cautious about going after Russia. We have the same power. We could do the same stuff against
Russia for sure. We didn't because we were worried about the ramifications for the, you know, our own
economy in the United States and the European economy. But yes, the Russia sanctions are the
biggest in terms of when you take both the scale of the sanctions and the size of the target.
But we have had more comprehensive sanctions on smaller targets like Iran. And we've also had
less comprehensive sanctions on bigger targets like China, right? With China being fully cut off
from frontier semiconductors from the United States. I mean, China is another order of magnitude
bigger than Russia. And we haven't yet gone after China with the kind of full scale financial hammer
that we've used against, you know, the Iran's and Russia's of the world.
So in the case of Russia, did it work, Eddie?
Um, it's a, it's a, it's a harder question than it seems. Well, because I'll break it down into,
into sort of two phases. The first phase really runs from 2021, the fall of 2021 till
February of 2022, because just to draw people's memories, you know, the US intelligence community
determines in the fall of 2021, six months almost before the full scale invasion that Russia is
about to invade Ukraine, which is really almost historically unprecedented to like see a crisis
coming from months away, you know, ordinarily, you know, a crisis happens and everyone in the
White House finds out about it at the same time that everyone does on CNN. And you run to the
situation room with your hair on fire saying, what do we do about it with this? It was like,
no, we had, you know, five, six months of advanced warning. And so the initial goal of economic
warfare vis-a-vis Russia was deterrence. It was to use the threat of quote, the most severe sanctions
that have ever been imposed to convince Putin that the costs of invasion would be too high
and then he shouldn't do it, right? That clearly failed, right? Once Putin invades Ukraine,
deterrence has failed. And so you move into a different phase of the sanctions where the
phase is what I would call attrition. What you're really trying to do is weaken Russia as much as
possible. And when you think about if one side of your policy is strengthening Ukraine through
military and economic assistance, as well as, you know, targeting assistance with, you know,
their war of defense against Russia's invasion, the other side of the equation is weakening Russia,
right? So you're trying to strengthen Ukraine and weaken Russia at the same time. In that respect,
it's very challenging to say, you know, yes, the sanctions have been impactful or no, they haven't.
What I can say with complete confidence is that we would be better off with the sanctions in place
than with help. Because if you didn't have any sanctions on Russia, Russia's economy would be
humming along even more so than it is now. They would have probably overwhelmed more of
Ukraine's territory and life would be just a lot easier for Russia. And I think this is one of the
things that I came to realize during my time in government is, you know, no tool of statecraft,
especially if you're trying to use a coercive tool, is like going to work in exactly the way you want
that often, right? I mean, even military force, you know, the US is the most powerful military
in the world. You know, Trump has been gloating about the fact that we had B2's takeoff in
Missouri and bomb Iran's nuclear facilities in like a 37-hour flight, which is an incredible
technical achievement. But we're not even sure where, you know, Iran's high enriched uranium is
right now, right? And they may actually, you may have inadvertently accelerated their push for a
nuclear weapon. So even military force doesn't always achieve the aims that you want it to.
And I think the same is true of economic warfare. Let's talk about the pros and cons
of economic warfare then. So maybe the pros first, right? So it strikes me that
for the US with this level of economic power, the ability to have deterrence and coercion
and to cause some economic pain to an adversary without a tank, without a missile, without the
sacrifice of any American lives, that's got to feel pretty high return on investment. So me,
let's talk about like, why economic sanctions are a good tool. And then we'll get into the
other side of it. Like, you know, why in many cases, they're not. Yeah. So I'm glad you're
asking this because, you know, I've obviously I wouldn't be an odd decision for me to spend
so much of my career working on this if I didn't think that they had some utility. Look, I guess
my own belief is that, you know, the world is a messy place. We oftentimes are dealing with problems
in the United States that are really hard. And we really don't want to fight wars, particularly
with other great powers, right? The prospect of a war with China or Russia is really almost hard
to imagine, right? These are nuclear armed states. And anytime you're directly engaging them
in warfare, you're risking the extinction of the human race. I mean, I say that, you know, like in
this friendly podcast conversation, but it's true, you know, and probably like our parents
and grandparents generation that was more like, oh, yeah, of course. Right. Because they were like,
you know, ducking and covering in their classrooms. Yes. Yeah, right. But like that is like the world
we live in. Right. And so there's a question like, well, if you want to advance American
interests internationally without using military force, what other options do you have? My own view
is that the next best, the next most impactful thing we have is our economic power. And so I do
think that sanctions and other weapons of economic warfare, like export controls have an important
role to play in advancing American interests around the world. Do I think that the US always
uses these tools wisely? Of course not. And I think in some ways we very, you know, we perhaps
use them unwisely more often than we should. But I think that they have a very important role,
particularly in trying to address really hard problems without risking war.
It seems like they're fairly high return on investment as well. I mean, how much does it
cost the US to impose these economic sanctions versus kind of its military might, the cost of
that? In any individual case, and I think this is what also makes this question hard to answer. In
any individual case, it almost feels costless, right? Where it's like, okay, well, we're cutting
this Russian bank off from the US financial system. Okay, you know, like, it's just another
one. You know, I think the reason it's hard is when you zoom out, well, what is the cumulative
impact? And this is actually something I'm focused on right now and sort of the next frontier of my
own research is, you know, this age of economic warfare we're living in, in which sanctions,
export controls, investment restrictions, tariffs have become the primary way that great powers
compete. Because I'll also say it's not just the US who's using these tools more and more.
It's China, it's the EU, it's Japan, it's Russia. They're always deployed in response to a specific
problem. It's okay, we want to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, or we want to weaken
Russia's military, or we want to, you know, win the AI race against China. So we want to prevent
them from getting Nvidia chips, right? But like, the cumulative effect is a full scale restructuring
of the global economy. It's undoing sort of the core tenets of globalization and hyperglobalization
from the 1990s. And that is the cumulative impact. And so I think there's a huge incentive for
policymakers, particularly in Washington, to use sanctions to address every single problem,
because it does feel kind of costless. But then if you don't have a more disciplined strategic
approach, you're like, okay, hold on a second, have I just cut off half of the countries of the
world from the dollar? Maybe I'm endangering the dollar's role as the global reserve currency,
and that has a whole litany of other problems that we probably don't want to bring about.
I mean, this seemed to me part of the argument of your book is that there is really no free lunch
here. And then there is kind of a hidden cost that compounds in the background. And that cost might
cost the US the entire empire or dollar supremacy or things that were very hard won for the US.
But before we get there, I actually want to ask the question of how the US even got to this place.
So you mentioned earlier in the conversation, Eddie, that you're actually on a sanction list.
You know, thank goodness, not sanctions from the US dollar, but from the ruble,
the Russian ruble. And I got to imagine that doesn't affect your life in the slightest.
Maybe it does. Have you felt any effects from this?
No. I mean, I have felt no effects. What I will say, though, and this may sound strange,
because when this happened, a lot of people emailed me and text me saying congrats, you know,
this is a badge of pride. I mean, my own view was like, look, I spent a summer in college living
in Russia. I love Russian literature. I like to think that one day in the future, Russia may be
not the worst of itself. It could be a less imperialist country. And so it made me a little
bit sad and nostalgic. And the fact that I lived in Russia at a time before they had launched
imperialist wars, and it was just in some ways a marker of just an end of an era.

So sad, mildly inconvenient, but certainly did not cause you much of any economic harm.
Zero.
Okay. So Zero, how does the US have the ability to do this, the leverage to do this? Where do
we need to go back in history to understand how the US became... I mean, we consider often when
we talk about the dollar at bankless, it's sort of the US's chief export, really. It's maybe our
most successful export is our capital markets, our dollar, our banking system, and we export it all
over the world. And it seems like the entire world has adopted it into their economies as the global
reserve currency. How did we get to that place? Was it an accident of history? Was this just like
because the US post-Bretton Woods dominated economics and monetary policy? How do we even
end up in this state? Because it seems like... You tell me, has there ever been a time in history
where a country, a nation state, an empire had this much economic power?
No. And to answer your initial question, which was, was this an accident or... Part of it was
accidental because if you go back to Bretton Woods, right? So this conference in the summer of 1944,
where the allied countries, while World War II is still raging, set kind of the architecture for the
new international economic order, the dollar is installed as a global reserve currency,
but it's also pegged to the dollar at $35 an ounce. So the way the Bretton Woods system works...
An ounce of gold, right?
Is the dollar is... The US is responsible for exchanging any dollar anyone gives it for gold
for $35 per ounce of gold. And then every other currency in the world, whether it's the French
franc or the British pound, is pegged to the dollar within a narrow band. I think they can
move it 1% or so every year, but it's effectively pegged to the dollar. And so the dollar is
officially made the global reserve currency by Bretton Woods, right? But it is effectively a
fixed exchange rate system. So there's only so far that finance can go, right? And if you go and
read the writings of John Maynard Keynes, who's an important architect, the belief of Keynes as
well as Harry Dexter White as a US counterpart was that fixed exchange rates were good because
you wanted to actually prioritize the real economy, exports, manufacturing over finance.
And capital controls were actually a core part of the system. You couldn't freely move capital
across borders. In some ways, it was illegal. In other parts, there were high taxes on capital
exchanges. And so it was not economically useful really to do. The thing that's super interesting
and where we get into accident is you go to 1971, August, where Richard Nixon goes in front of the
American people and says, we are no longer exchanging dollars for gold at $35 an ounce.
The US unilaterally terminates this system and says, we are no longer part of it. And it's really
because in the years leading up to that with the Vietnam War, the US is starting to run deficits.
More and more countries starting with France are actually going and exchanging their dollars for
gold. So there's a run basically on the dollar and the America's gold reserves. And so the US
can't defend that price anymore. And within two years, there's also the Arab oil embargo,
which is catastrophic for the US economy. It causes the start of this decade of stagflation.
The thing that's so interesting is you go back and you read contemporary accounts and everyone
says, it's over. American economic dominance, RIP. In the 70s, they were saying this.
Yeah, in the early 70s. Because we had just ended, we basically abdicated our position
at the center of the international financial system. And we're reeling from this inflation
driven by an Arab oil embargo. And in the wake of that, with the US running these completely
unsustainable deficits in 1974, Richard Nixon is floundering amid the Watergate scandal,
he's completely distracted. He appoints this guy as Treasury Secretary named Bill Simon. He's a
former bond trader. He's from New Jersey. I've got this great picture of my book,
him testifying before Congress with a plume of smoke over his head. These are people that you
don't really see too much. They're a relic of the past and maybe for better, maybe for worse.
And Simon comes up with this scheme that I think only a bond trader could have come up with where
he says, well, maybe what I need to do in order to allow us to keep running these deficits is I
need to persuade the countries that are accumulating dollars to buy our debt, to buy Treasuries.
And so in July of 1974, he flies from Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington to Jeddah,
the Saudi coastal city. Long flight, gets copiously drunk on the flight by drinking whiskey,
which he does. And he's watching these really gruesome horror films on the flight. And he's
doing this because he's like this macho American. He's like, oh, it's illegal to drink in Saudi
Arabia. And yet despite his crazy behavior, he does strike a deal with the Saudis where
he persuades the Saudis both to continue pricing oil and dollars and to take all of their excess
oil profits and reinvest them in US government debt in exchange for the ability to buy US debt
outside of the normal auction. So they didn't have to participate in the auctions that are public,
that everyone sees this could be done under the radar way and for preferential access to US
military equipment. So there is a deal that links the dollar to oil. So initially the dollar is
linked to gold basically, then it kind of de facto becomes linked to oil. And with, by the way,
the end of capital controls, with the end of fixed exchange rates, the dollar then can kind
of fluctuate based on market demand. You actually see an explosion of the use of the dollar around
the world. And also the other interesting thing, another story I tell in choke points, we could go
on forever. The Euro dollar market, which is this initially illicit offshore dollar lending market
that originates in London, the US government basically endorses it. We start saying, okay,
well, even though this was sort of developed by private banks, these are not the same as dollars
that are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, the Federal Reserve. We think
this is good because it increases ultimately demand for US dollars and ultimately US treasuries.
And so this is the beginning of a whole new system where instead of trade in the real economy being
the main thing that America is solving for, it's the financial sector that's let loose. And then
that gets kicked into high gear with the deregulation drives during the Carter administration,
the Reagan administration, and the Clinton administration, where you get to a point where
by the time the Cold War ends and China and Russia are about to enter the global economy,
we live in this hyper-dollarized world. It's striking that it is this combination
of strategy and also accident of history maybe, or just serendipity, that the petrodollar,
which you just described basically the birth of the US petrodollar, was more successful,
had higher product market fit than the goldback dollar of the previous era and is just saturated
into every nook and cranny of the financial world. Not to say that this hasn't cost the US. I mean,
I think there's increasingly some chatter and some argument. You talk about the Triffin dilemma,
that sort of thing, that this really fueled our trade deficits, hollowed out the manufacturing
class of the US, and has really made the US economy thrive on financialization and
weakened our position globally. And maybe let's talk about, not quite that, but getting back to
the costs of economic sanctions. So moving back to Russia, and we described this where
suddenly in a couple of days or weeks, 250 billion of their central bank reserve assets
are just frozen. They have to be thinking to themselves, I can't believe we got ourselves
into this. What the hell? I'm sure there was much more that Putin said about this.
And this can never happen again. And so let's talk about the cost of economic sanctions,
because it strikes me, Eddie, that what countries will just do is not let this happen again. They
will start to route around, build around the US petrodollar infrastructure empire and create
their own networks and their own monetary routes. Can you describe that story a little bit?
Yes. And I think this is a very astute observation. And it's not just Russia, by the way,
who's saying we'll never have this happen again. It's any country who worries that they may one
day come into the crosshairs of Western economic warfare. And so I think a big reason you've seen
this massive run up in the price of gold since 2022 is because central banks in this sort of
store value bucket of uses of a currency are saying, well, we feel more comfortable accumulating
gold than we do accumulating US treasuries. I'm sure, although I would defer to you as the
expert on crypto, that the run up in the price of Bitcoin potentially has something to do with
this as well, where you have bigger buyers in offshore jurisdictions who are saying,
this is a hedge against the dollar. I think that in some ways, the thing I'm even more interested
in though, is this medium of exchange element. Because I got over telling you how even when
India and Saudi Arabia are trading with each other, this is cutting through a US bank account,
ultimately. And so there's a choke point that the US government can use to stop the transaction
from happening. Since the Russia sanctions, a number of efforts to try to evade that choke
point have been really accelerated. So one that predates it, but I think it was also motivated
by American economic power, was the ECNY or the digital renminbi. It's a Chinese central bank
digital currency. You now have many central banks around the world. Actually, the US is
an oddball that we don't have this, who are building these central bank digital currencies.
And China, in association with the central banks of Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia,
and the Bank of International Settlements, has actually built a platform called M-Bridge
that allows different countries who are part of this platform to clear cross border payments
using their own central bank digital currencies. And those types of transactions do not have to
touch a Citibank correspondent account here in New York City. They have no nexus to the US financial
system at all. And actually, at the end of 2024, the Bank of International Settlements dropped out
of this project, M-Bridge, which has effectively left the People's Bank of China, the Chinese
central bank, completely in charge. And they are now basically trying to expand that, bringing
in other members. You've seen the BRICS talking about clearing cross border payments as an
incredibly high priority. So it wouldn't surprise me if M-Bridge winds up becoming
the main vehicle for that. Wow. Okay. So let's talk about that more because you were talking
about the different use cases of money, right? We have store of value, we have medium exchange
unit of account. So from a store of value perspective, yeah, I do think you're right.
This has been part of the narrative of some of the US adversary central banks and even non-US
adversary central banks are saying, yeah, do we really want to hold this level of treasuries if
they could be frozen? So they're slowly diversifying to other assets, maybe harder
assets, particularly gold at this stage. What's interesting though is it seems like for the store
of value use case, there's a little bit of mutually assured destruction there, which is like
the central banks would also sell boatloads of treasuries on the open market and do really nasty
things to US bond prices and yield prices. So maybe that's happening in a slow way,
but what's happening in a faster way are these alternative payment networks.
And so when you're looking at the alternative payment networks, is the Chinese alternative
payment network and their central bank digital currency, is that the one that is vying for
primary alternative to the US or are their pockets, their fragmented pockets of different payment
networks that are starting to spring into action? When Russia and China do some trade,
what do they use? In the non-digital currency world,
the non-blockchain world, China has also created something called SIPs or the Cross-Border
Interbank Payment System, which is the Chinese equivalent of SWIFT or the Belgian-based
messaging service we talked about before, as well as CHIPS, which is the Clearinghouse Interbank
Payment System. It's the US-based system that actually clears dollar transactions. So China
has created their alternative. Russia also has one called SPFS that they created. Both of these,
by the way, initiatives, interestingly enough, were founded in around 2014, so after the initial
Russian invasion of Ukraine and sanctions that were put in place. So they've been
percolating for a while, but SIPs, the Chinese version, has grown quite quickly. Russia has
effectively yuanized its economy. Their main foreign exchange reserve right now asset is the
Chinese renminbi. They settle most of their payments in RMB. And look, that's put them
at the mercy of China, which I think eventually is going to be a very big problem, but it's been a
survival tactic for Russia, and China has been only too happy to oblige. I think strategically,
though, if you are going to fundamentally threaten the dollar's role as a medium of exchange,
I don't think it's going to be done through China creating correspondent bank networks and using
SIPs. And I think it's really going to be done through a paradigm shift through, okay, it is
just better to clear cross-border payments using digital currencies. It's way faster,
it's more trackable. I don't know if anyone, listeners to your podcast have tried to make
an international wire transfer recently. Oh, gosh, yes. It's a constant complaint.
This podcast is called Bankless Eddie, so yes. So yeah, it could take a week or more.
There's a lot of middlemen involved. There are fees you have to pay for wires, right? I mean,
there is a... Setting aside any geopolitics, technologically, cross-border digital payments
are better. They're faster, right? They're faster. They're more direct, right? And so I think that
we are at the precipice of a major shift in terms of how cross-border payments work.
China has by far the biggest and most advanced state-backed project to do this through both the
ECNY as well as Enbridge, this platform that they built with other central banks. And so the question
is, can the US retain its lead? And the US, as listeners to your podcast will know, has made a
big bet that it will actually be through the private market. It'll be through stable coins,
not through a digital dollar or a US-backed central bank digital currency that the US will
be able to retain its lead. And we may be right, but it is a really interesting bet to make. When
you look at all the other big central banks, PBOC, the European Central Bank has a digital euro.
They're all doing at least wholesale central bank digital currencies. The US is going all in on
stable coins. And in some ways, interestingly enough, it mirrors this period in the 1960s.
I talked about this in my book in 1970s, where the euro dollar market starts as this quasi-illicit
dollar market that exists offshore. And eventually the US government's like, hey,
this is really important. We actually should just co-opt this. And so I see the same thing happening
at the very least with stable coin right now, where the US government's like, look, we need to
figure out a way to actually win this race for the future of payments. And the best way to do it is
to take these various US dollar-pegged stable coins and co-opt them and make them the instruments
of our own influence. Yeah, I like that. Very much like that euro dollars comparison with
stable coins. In fact, a friend of the podcast, frequent guest Nick Carter, he's tried to rebrand
these things to, let's call them crypto dollars rather than stable coins. Why don't we just do
that? That's more fitting. And I think that's a good label for what they actually are. And so
are you painting a picture, Eddie? I want to talk more about stable coins and crypto digital assets
and how they fit into the full story here, but are you painting a picture of maybe three networks,
three types of networks emerging here? So we've got the traditionally US dominated network,
Chips and Swift, and that's got full dominance, the 90%. Then we've got a payments network
coming out of the Chinese central bank, so the PBOC, and that's doing its thing. Maybe Russia
is the first to one-eyes their economy. Maybe they won't be the last. Maybe China continues
to try to use its economic might to co-opt countries closer into that system. So that's
maybe the second. And this third is maybe decentralized crypto networks as another viable
successor to, and I don't know if I want to use the successor term, but to start eroding market
share from the current dominant monetary system, which is Swift and Chips.
Yes. I think that's a fair outline of the current players in the race. I don't think that's
necessarily the only players that may enter the race because I mentioned, we've talked about the
Russia sanctions of 2022 as this big pivot point where China starts building its alternative
infrastructure. I worry that Trump's liberation day tariffs from early April may have been sort
of a similar fork in the road where now Europe may also become a player, right? Because you're
seeing the dollar, for instance, steadily depreciate, decline against the euro since
April. And I think in some ways the euro has a fighting chance now, particularly if this
digital euro thing works. So I wouldn't say that they're anywhere close to where the other three
projects are, but I wouldn't fully count them out because they start from a pretty good spot
where 20% of foreign exchange reserves right now are in euros. And a lot of the reasons
you may not like the European Union, which is like it's slow, it's bureaucratic, may actually
be effective when it comes to payments. Because with payments, you just don't want to think about
it. You don't want to be to worry about arbitrary and capricious moves. So I do think the euro
may also be a fourth horse in the race, but we'll see how that develops.
Yeah, this is fascinating. It's just not just US adversaries, but it might even be US allies
that are looking to alternative to Swift. As maybe a bellwether of this, I saw this post from
somebody I follow just generally. He's in traditional finance. He writes a lot about
money. His name is JP Koning. I don't know if you've ever run across his blog.
I think I've read a few things by him.
He wrote this in April. He's Canadian, so he lives in Canada. He wrote this blog post,
Trump-proofing Canada means ending our dependence on Swift. This is our neighbors to the North,
the peaceful Canadians. The first line of this is, it's time to stop staring at the headlights
and respond to the fact that Canada is being eyes as a choice morsel by the much larger predator,
our former ally, the United States of America. Basically, he goes on to make the case that
we can't be as Canada if we want. Look, there's economic warfare going on. There's tariffs going
on. We don't know what the shape of the US as allies are going to look like in the future.
We're utterly dependent on Swift. One tool that Trump hasn't yet used in the tariff negotiations
is like, heck, cut you off Swift, Canada. How would that feel? Anyway, I don't know how widespread
this is, but even allies are sort of looking at this and saying, should we be dependent on
the US as a payment network at this point? The difference between what Trump has done
in the last few months on economic warfare and his predecessors, I think is important to call out,
because on the one hand, it is a continuation in that every single president in the 21st century,
from George W. Bush to Barack Obama to Trump's first term to Biden and now to Trump again,
has actually imposed sanctions at twice the rate of their predecessor. There is this structural
secular trend where there's this more and more sanctions, tariffs, export controls.
The thing that Trump has done differently is this weaponization of American economic power
against everybody and unilaterally, critically, doing it all by ourselves. As we talked about
earlier, with the Russia sanctions of 2022, the US acted in unison with the issuers of the other
big reserve currencies, the euro, the pound, the yen, to sanction Russia. As a result, it wasn't
like the euro was seen as a viable hedge against the dollar. If anything, actually, the euro lost
share against the dollar between 2022 and 2025, because they were seen as geopolitically equivalent,
but the dollar is much more useful. If the US is just weaponizing the dollar and American
technology against everybody else, there's going to be an incentive to hedge. It's not just the
RMB or Bitcoin or gold. It's also the euro that could be a viable alternative. There are people
in Canada who want to join the EU. They're talking about building oil and gas pipelines
so that they can export their energy from coasts to places like Europe and Asia instead of selling
everything to the United States. I do worry that that is the novelty of Trump's approach, which is
this unilateral use of economic warfare against so many other countries, adversaries and allies
alike, which I do think could put more horses in this race for the future of global finance.
Is that just generally what you see in the future of Europe to predict the future,
Eddie? Is it the balkanization of the financial system? I mean,
90% market share is pretty hard for any entity to maintain in monopoly status. It appears like that
is fragmenting at the edges, but is that the future we just balkanize, the US loses?
Maybe not. It'll still be a reserve currency, but maybe one of several and not the only. Do
we lose that dominance that we've had in the past? Yes, that is definitely the direction of travel.
If you were to just look at all of the various factors and make the most rational forecast,
it's that the dollar isn't going to be supplanted as the global dominant currency. It's just that
other currencies, including these challengers like cryptocurrencies, are going to chip away
at the dollar's share across all of the metrics, whether it's unit of account,
medium of exchange, or store value. You will eventually get something like a multipolar
monetary order. At the same time, we also got over talking about a few minutes ago, the fact that
if you went back in the early 70s and we were doing this podcast then, we would say,
oh, the US is toast. Yeah, it's over.
Yeah. You never know, right? We may pull a rabbit out of the hat. I think right now,
probably, if I were to make the case that actually no, the dollar is going to be even
more dominant 10 years from now, I think you have to make some sort of big bet on stablecoin,
on the idea that you could, in a way, start seeing everyday consumers, businesses, et cetera,
in the developing world start using the dollar in their everyday transactions. I know you had the
head of Tether on your podcast recently making this case. I think that is possible. In some ways,
that would make the dollar even more ubiquitous, right? But a lot of things have to go right
for us to get to that endpoint.
Well, let's talk about stablecoins. I would love your perspective and somebody that has
previously worked on economic sanctions, financial sanctions, that kind of thing.
We have stablecoins. Now, it seems like the Trump administration is full steam ahead.
It looks like, let's say, the genius bill passes, that's in the Senate,
it's going to get kicked over to the House. It could pass in July, August. It still has
sanctions. It's part of it. There's the full Bank Secrecy Act requirements, AML KYC.
There's a bit more freedom of travel with respect to from one crypto wallet to another crypto
wallet, which is somewhat interesting. It's something that I think privacy and crypto
advocates have really hoped would happen and it seems like that's the case. But just generally,
what's your lens on stablecoins and thinking about that and maybe through the lens of
economic sanctions as well?
I do believe we are on the precipice of a big change in terms of how cross-border payments work.
Because my own view is, when there are new technologies that clearly improve the status
quo, it's hard to restrain them indefinitely, right? And if you can clear a cross-border
payment in seconds, as opposed to two weeks, we should probably do the thing that allows that
payment to happen in seconds, right? So my own view in terms of stablecoins is, it seems like,
unless there's a big political shift in the US, we are really putting all the eggs in the stablecoin
basket. We're not doing even a wholesale central bank digital currency. And even if there's a new
president in 2029 who authorizes the Fed to do a digital dollar, it might be too late at that point,
given how fast some of these alternatives coming out of China are developing.
So my own view is, if I were to wave a magic wand, I would say we need to figure out a way
to ensure that a well-regulated stablecoin ecosystem develops, one that is not used for
corrupt practices, is not used for illicit practices, where American consumers are protected,
where they're not going to lose their money because of some sort of scam or something like
that. And critically, that there are these AML KYC requirements so that they're not being used
as a way to skirt sanctions. My own view is that's possible, right? You could build a stablecoin
ecosystem where the US has zero less power than they do today to impose sanctions. And that would
be good, right? Because I think ultimately you get the benefits without having the costs with the
dollar being used to fund Iran's nuclear program or finance Putin's imperialism, right? So that
would be sort of my macro take. And I hope the genius bill is a step in that direction.
Have you read the text? What do you think about it?
I'm not steeped in it. I'm not steeped in it. It's something I need to do
probably a little bit more of. But I think it's better than the status quo, for sure.
And the idea that you could actually start going in this direction. I think the idea that you're
going to have one piece of legislation that is the perfect regulatory framework is not going to
happen, right? You're going to need the willingness to iterate over time to see how things are working,
to have different regulations that are put in place, to have new laws put in place.
But I think it's a step in the right direction. You need a well-regulated ecosystem if this is
going to be viable over the long term. Yeah. I mean, we had Senator Bill Haggerty
on a couple of weeks ago. He's one of the bill's co-authors. And you walk through it. Obviously,
he's a proponent of it since he is one of the authors. And it does have some of the
protections you're talking about. It's like full reserves, audited. They're all backed by
dollar-backed instruments, treasuries and the like. And so is an improvement from some of the other
so-called stable coins that we've had in crypto that were like endogenous collateral.
And you may have heard of Terra Luna. There's a stable coin that collapsed in 2022 and some
of those things. So I think some of that regulation is happening. Let me ask you a question from the
desk of somebody who's sort of been inside of the belly of the beast and the US government.
So in all of the cases of economic sanctions, you've talked about, we've seen those economic
sanctions being imposed on foreign adversaries, not US citizens. And there's an interesting kind
of, I guess, civil liberties take and worry that I have personally about these same powers being
deployed domestically. And they are incredible powers we just illustrated. You're going through
the, what would it feel like to be cut off from the US dollar? One thing, if you're in a foreign
country, what would it feel like to be cut off from the US dollar if you're a US citizen
living in New York City? What do you do? And there are totalitarian states like China, for instance,
that do seem to have that power tying into social credit systems and the like. And that level of
capability deployed domestically in the US is just a path that we don't want to go down.
So what's your concern about that? I know there are some laws that protect against it,
but there are... I mean, I'm not sure that we have good kind of privacy and protections
in place or to the extent that we need. I'm not sure Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act even,
I'm not sure that that is protecting citizens to the extent that it could be.
06 It's pretty rare for
the Treasury Department to impose sanctions on US citizens. Almost always in the cases where it is,
it's a dual national, where they're a Russian who's gained American citizenship or something.
And even in those cases, oftentimes they refrain from doing it just because Americans have due
process rights. And it's quite a step, I think, for an executive branch agency just to freeze
your bank accounts and cut you off from the dollar. That is terrifying, right? So I'm with you. I
think that it's scary. And I do think that in some ways we've seen the Trump administration
be willing to weaponize parts of state control over economic organs to advance its own agenda
against American citizens, right? And there are accusations that this also happened during
previous administrations. I know through crypto companies not being able to get bank accounts,
I don't have any insider perspective on that. But I think that that's absolutely terrifying
and that these tools should never be used against US citizens. I think that even when we use them
against foreign citizens, we really do need to have some level of empathy because they're not
friendly tools to use, right? We should really only be using these tools when there's a vital
US national security interest at stake. We shouldn't be using them willy-nilly. I think in my ideal
world, we would have probably five sanctions programs instead of 30. But in the cases where
we actually do think that we really need to use economic warfare, like Russia trying to conquer
a sovereign country or Iran trying to build a nuclear program that threatens the existence
of Israel and potentially could have a nuclear terrorist attack on US soil, then we should go
much harder, right? I would have fewer sanctions programs, but the times when we do use them,
when it's a serious, vital national security interest at stake, we should go very big.
I'm interested in this as we maybe start to close this out, Eddie. If your opinion is different than
the bankless opinion, that's maybe even more interesting about this. We've talked about
stablecoins, which have AMLKYC sort of attached and they're much more regulated cousins to
crypto native assets. So something like a Bitcoin or something like an Ether, right? Something that
really US economic sanctions have much less power over because they're decentralized network. Now,
maybe you're kind of shaking your head because you're like, well, we haven't really tried.
And to some extent, that's true. I mean, there's the ability to kind of free stablecoins, but
I wonder, are there any cases where the US has actually gone out and tried to like seize
someone's Bitcoin in a foreign country and what that would even look like? Could they even do it?
Yeah. So I'm skeptical. There is this take in the crypto community, which is, oh, this is going to
end American sanctions power. To me, that is just not the case. And interestingly enough,
if you look at the biggest fine for sanctions violations that the US government has meted out
in recent years, it was against Binance, right? It was about a $4 billion fine against effectively
a crypto company, which the CEO actually went to jail, right? So I mean, the US government has
quite a bit of power even over crypto companies. The other thing too, is when you think about the
concept of choke points, and this gets into the broader concept of my book and takes our
conversation full circle, like there are areas of the global economy where one country has a
dominant position. There are few, if any, substitutes, right? The dollar is this really
important choke point. It's the most important today. It's why we've talked about it. There are
other ones, right? The US has used semiconductors as a choke point against China. China has used
its dominance of rare earth minerals and batteries as a choke point for economic warfare
against the United States. Well, think about Bitcoin, right? Who's running all of the cloud
computing network and the servers that all of these- Bitcoin monitors being a choke point,
basically, is what you're saying. Yeah, I mean, there are probably other infrastructural layers
in the economy that the US government could use if it really wanted to come down hard on crypto
companies. I don't see why that should be the case, but I also don't think that we have not
yet seen industrial scale sanctions evasion using cryptocurrency, and I think there's a reason for
that. Are you glad we live in a world where there's at least that option or that kind of release
valve, a way to sort of route around some of these choke points and maybe the case is to get around
totalitarian regimes? Yeah, no, for sure. And I do think that there is this scenario where especially
dollar-backed stablecoins could be used as an alternative to domestic currencies that really
you can't trust or domestic regimes where you may have your assets confiscated. So I do think there
is a role, there is a civil liberties role for various cryptocurrencies to play. At the same time,
I do think that it is important for the US to retain the power when I say the US government
to retain the power to use economic warfare against foreign countries. And again, I wish
we lived in a world where this wasn't necessary, but if we're going to accept that geopolitical
competition is a fact of life, and unfortunately, it's intensifying, it's much worse than it was
when I was a kid, the 90s, when we sort of basically didn't have geopolitical competition
for a short period of time, like you need some tools of leverage. And if you don't have viable
economic tools, I worry that we'll wind up fighting more military wars, that basically
the alternative to sanctions oftentimes isn't peace or doing nothing, it's dropping bombs.
And I think the clearest demonstration of that is in 2018, when Donald Trump pulled out of the
Iran nuclear deal, he made a bet that maximum pressure sanctions on Iran, that crushing their
economy, even more so than Obama did, would get him an even better nuclear deal. And ultimately,
that bet failed. And the result was airstrikes against Iran, first by Israel, then by the United
States, which does potentially threaten to bring us into yet another war in the Middle East.
And so I do worry that if we don't have these tools, we will wind up fighting more wars,
and it'll be more risk to the US ultimately. So is that the message of your book,
we want these tools, but we need to use them sparingly in order for them to remain effective?
Exactly. We need to use sanctions more intelligently. And I think maybe my biggest
takeaway is the way that we plan and execute military force is incredibly serious, right?
We train and recruit professional troops, many of whom spend decades of their life in the US
military. We game plan out wars, we do tabletop exercises, military exercises. So by the time the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is advising the president in the situation room about what to
do, there is really good basis for these decisions, even though sometimes you make the wrong call.
With sanctions and economic warfare, oftentimes it's a whimsical, poorly thought through decision.
And so I think we need, honestly, the biggest goal of my book, Choke Points, is to demystify
economic warfare so more people can feel like they understand this topic so that they could weigh in,
improve our policy outcomes, and ultimately get us to a better place.
Well, I think that's exactly what you did today. And I was hoping for a crash course in sanctions,
and I think that's exactly what we got. So Eddie Fishman, thank you so much for joining us on
Bankless. The book is called Choke Points, American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.
I highly recommend it. And I'll end with this. Of course, you guys know none of this has been
financial advice. It's not even economic sanctions advice. Okay, crypto is risky. So is the monetary
system of the world. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier.
It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot, and thanks, Eddie.
