We are here in a beautiful garden villa.
Kansas is a little warm, but we got some shade and some fans, so there's no complaints.
Thanks so much InfraGardens for organizing this and having us.
We have a great lineup.
You look at the underlying technology, that's when you see the beauty of it, and it's really
hard to go back once you see the actual beauty of what we're doing.
This is actually one of the reasons why I love working in blockchain.
As they continue to expand their vision and their plan for how crypto-rails can integrate
into the Robinhood product, they also announced that we're going to be working together to
launch the Robinhood chain.
Guys, it really feels like we've graduated from the infrastructure era.
You guys, we did it.
I love these questions.
The yield that you can get in DeFi and the fact that it's been around for so long is
becoming apparent to business owners that are trying to deliver more value to their
users.
So I would argue that actually the evolution in the last few months is more awareness
that the technology exists and has been securing assets for some time, as opposed to the maturation
of the infrastructure itself.
I think it will be an interesting theme for the next few months and years here in crypto,
so I'm excited to see what's going to come from this.
Just like the internet, I don't think this will ever stop moving forward, and that's
a good thing.
We will constantly innovate, we can't do it overnight, but as long as we're all just pissed
and moving forward and trying to disrupt the world, I think that's the best place we could
be.
Shout out to Dia for putting on such a great event.
Thanks to all the panelists.
This was great.
Thanks for having us.
Thank you.
