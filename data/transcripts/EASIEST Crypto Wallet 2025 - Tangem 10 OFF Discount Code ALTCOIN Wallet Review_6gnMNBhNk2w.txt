Why are so many people saying that this crypto wallet is one of the easiest hardware wallets
they have ever used? Today I want to tell you about an awesome crypto hardware wallet and
because you're watching this video, I got you a 10% discount if you use our link below. Save this
video. 10% discount on all products is a very good deal. The crypto wallet that I'm talking about
is called Tangem, partner of the channel. This wallet is actually quite popular. 4 million
Tangem cards have been produced already and zero of them have ever been hacked. That's actually
one of the things that makes this wallet super unique and user friendly. These cards and the
app that goes with it. I've tried this product in person. The company actually sent me a couple of
their latest models to try and I understand why this is so popular. I understand why people are
buying and using these. The Tangem cards or even the ring, it's so easy to tap. This app is so easy
to use and yes, this product is super secure, beautifully designed. You tap it to your phone
and it works. It doesn't need a seed phrase. You can store almost any token on it and the price
starts at just $55 minus the 10% discount you use with our link. It could also be a good idea for
you to get more than two cards for different wallets. Also the Tangem ring looks really cool.
It's very interesting. They have a bank card and a ring option. I like this. Let's dive deeper into
why this product is so cool. Once again, take advantage of my 10% discount as soon as possible.
It's not going to be here forever and remember it is strongly recommended. Best practice in crypto
to have a hardware wallet, to use a hardware or cold wallet. Do you know why? Because it's the
only way to make sure nobody steals your crypto. That's why you become your own bank though. You
do become responsible. I use hot wallets too, of course. I have extensions like Metamask,
but it always comes with a little bit more of a greater risk or greater vulnerabilities when you
use hot wallets. So my point is, with this product or with hardware wallets in general,
there are just so many less ways for people to steal your crypto or for you to get fished
because you're using a hardware wallet. If you have a long-term crypto bag, anything above a
certain amount of money, it might be a good idea to invest in a cold storage wallet. And by the way,
Tangem works and is even cooler than most other wallets out there. You tap it to your phone,
use it just like a bank card. You don't need to push any buttons and you don't need to charge it.
Smash the like button. Let's take a deeper dive into the value proposition and safety and security
of this product, of course. So more about the product. The card has an NFC chip, but it's not
just a chip. It actually has a built-in EAL 6 plus. This is the highest standard of security,
25-year warranty, and the card itself is very durable, high quality, water resistant. The tech
itself, it's the exact same technology that you use already when you pay with your phone by tapping
it or a card tapping it at the grocery store. Also, the open source software here is available
on GitHub, allowing external audits and the ability to recreate the app if Tangem goes out
of business. The firmware for this product is not upgradeable. That's a unique value proposition in
the crypto market. No malicious features or upgrades can be added to this product. They
have anti-counterfeiting protection, meaning they're one of the first and only companies to
have introduced a firmware validation function, meaning the Tangem application on your phone
checks whether the card's firmware is authentic and has not been modified. And then the private
keys themselves are stored on up to three Tangem cards, never connected to the internet. You are
the sole owner of the private keys. Tangem does not store the private key information on its servers,
has no access to them. Audited by these two known names in this space, the two independent audits
confirm that Tangem's firmware has no backdoors or vulnerabilities and cannot be updated. Plus,
ISO certification, which means protection against electromagnetic pulses,
electrostatic discharges, and x-rays. Tangem does not collect any private data from users.
They don't have any servers to store it, no addresses, no keys, no personal information.
But if you already have a hardware wallet like Ledger, which I mean I like Ledger too,
the question is why should I get a Tangem wallet? Well, first of all, look at this beauty. It's
definitely the coolest, looks just like a bank card, looks just like a slick ring, which it is.
It's simple, accessible, set up in just three minutes, easy and fast. You sign transactions
with just one tap, always by your hand, compatible with your phone, doesn't require long onboarding.
It's tap and go. So it's much more convenient for everyday usage than a lot of crypto hardware
wallet options. Because keep in mind, this is for everything you want to do in crypto. This is for
all operations in crypto. Buy, sell, transfer, stake, connect to DeFi with just one tap of your
card or ring. By the way, the ring has the same chip as the card. Only the design is different.
You also tap it to your phone. When you tap, the wallet is activated. It generates a new
random private key. This is another reason I like Tangem. Security seems to be a priority.
And it's a visionary technology developed by Tangem. Tangem wallet is the first seedless
wallet. You don't have to memorize any secret passphrases. And that's interesting. But if
you want to, you can also import other wallets into the Tangem app using seed phrases or create
a new seed phrase and activate a new wallet in Tangem. Once you get this, once you tap the
card, it takes about three minutes for the wallet to activate and generate the private key and
activates the two other cards as backup. And then you use the Tangem wallet app on your phone.
And the design for the app is also just as beautiful. The Tangem app supports Bitcoin,
Ethereum, all Ethereum tokens, XRP, Doge, BNB, Cardano, and more than 85 block chains in total.
And please remember this app can do so much more than just store your crypto. You can buy,
you can sell, you can swap tokens, you can stake, you can connect to dApps, you can check markets,
you can monitor token prices, and you can also store and manage NFTs. You'll also be able to
earn crypto with staking and other earning tools. Also, the app is capable of using biometric
security and access codes. The app is available for both Android and iOS. Download links in the
description. Note that your phone does need to be compatible with NFC chips, but if you can Google
Pay or Apple Pay with your phone, then your phone is compatible with NFC. Security, security, security.
Let me tell you a little bit more about Tangem's security. This fact surprised me. Out of the
four million Tangem cards produced, none of them have been hacked. Zero. So Tangem has an amazing
security track record, plus it passed security certifications by known firms. And by the way,
Tangem itself is based in Switzerland, a country known for high quality products. The chip in the
card was developed with Samsung semiconductors and has the same security certification as the
chips in passports and bank cards. It's resistant to extreme temperatures, x-rays, water, dust,
everything. So your crypto is safe with Tangem. No other hardware wallet uses chips with such a
high level of security certification and the 25 year warranty. I mean, enough said. Tangem rings
have the same security features and are just as resistant, including to scratches. They are made
from a material called zirconia ceramic, which looks like titanium, but it's very light. I love it.
You can also wear it on a chain like a necklace. So I've already told you about several big
advantages to Tangem. Security, design, use the tap technology, great app functionality.
The next huge advantage is smart backups. You can actually get not only one, but two or three Tangem
cards with your wallet, depending on what set you order. These are like three keys that open the
same door. And as for the ring, a ring comes as part of a set with two cards. It's the safest
option, of course, because if you wear the ring, you hopefully won't lose it. The card that generates
the private key encrypts it, shares it with the other cards. So you can continue using the wallet,
even if something happens to the original card, but nobody can ever steal the private key. You
can activate smart backups only once. That's yet another security measure. And for more info on
security, go to Tangem's official chat on Telegram and ask your questions in their Telegram. The
links for that are in the description. Oh, and before I forget, Tangem recently announced a
partnership with Visa. You are able to join the wait list. You will be able to send cryptocurrency
directly from the hardware wallet to any place Visa is accepted. So by now, you probably want
to know how to order a Tangem smart card wallet and ring. It's very easy. Click on the 10% discount
link under this video and go to the order page and choose which set you want. You can get two
smart cards for basically 50 bucks if you use our special discount, normally 55 bucks, or three
cards for $62, 63. Which one is better? Well, the thing is, if you have three cards, even if you
lose one card and forget your access code, you can use the third card to reset the PIN code.
But with only two cards, if you lose one, you must remember the access codes. So three cards
are always safer. And you can also turn off the option to reset the PIN code. Next, you choose
the color. The options are different shades of gray, red, yellow, green, pastels, special editions.
And the option that I like, it's a blank card, like stealth mode. So nobody can guess that it's
a crypto wallet. I prefer gray, but if it's a gift for a girl or something, I think the pastels do
look very pretty. Tangem offers free shipping for orders over $125. So if you buy a family pack,
shipping will be free. The delivery time is just a few days for most countries. What about the
rings? Well, it's obviously a pretty similar checkout process. Simply click the link in my
description for the 10% discount and go to the order page. You'll need to choose a ring size.
If you're not sure, click on size guide and watch a video on how to measure your finger
and figure out your ring size. It's actually quite easy. And a set of one ring and two smart cards
cost $160. But for you, that's only $144 because of the 10% discount. You know, I always like to see
interesting and unique products like this catered to real needs in the crypto space. It's very cool
that something like this exists and people can choose to use it. Check it out for yourself.
