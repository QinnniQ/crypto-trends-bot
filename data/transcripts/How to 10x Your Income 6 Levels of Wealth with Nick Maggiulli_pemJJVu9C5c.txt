If you want to go past 10 million, AKA level five, you have to completely change your strategy.
Unlike everything so far in the wealth ladder, like going from level three to level four is
usually just like having a higher paying job and just being able to save more and invest well.
And, you know, you just give it time and that's a lot of it too. Like time's a piece of it.
The difference between, you know, level four and level five is not just time.
Welcome to Bankless. This is Ryan Chon Adams, just me today. You guys know crypto is a
technology for both generating and for storing wealth. The question is, what is wealth?
Every once in a while, I like to do an episode on wealth just to set the foundation.
Because just like crypto, wealth can be a freedom technology.
And if it's used well, that's exactly what it is. It can also be a trap.
Sahil Bloom reinforced this idea for me in his book, The Five Types of Wealth.
We did an episode on that. It's a great conversation. We'll include a link in the
show notes for you. Now this episode with Nick Medjuli, our guest, swings the focus back towards
one type of wealth, net worth. So picture a ladder. You start with nothing. Then as you climb each
rung of the ladder, your strategy needs to change in order to get to the next level.
You hit 10K and then you hit 100K in net worth, then a million, and then 10 million and beyond.
How do you climb each rung of this wealth ladder? What strategies do you need to achieve
deca-millionaire status? Also, everyone assumes they want 10 million in net worth.
But is it worth it? These are all topics we discuss in today's episode. Again,
to round out this conversation, I do encourage you to listen to the episode we did with Sahil
and The Five Types of Wealth. Because I don't want you guys getting stuck on a wealth
treadmill to nowhere. But if you do want to climb, I think this episode will help.
We'll get right to the episode. But before we do, I want to thank the sponsors that made this possible.

Nick Medjuli. He is the author of Just Keep Buying, and he is part of a wealth management
company as well, and he's got a soon-to-be-released book called The Wealth Ladder coming out. We're
going to learn from him about The Wealth Ladder today. Nick, how are you doing?
Nick Medjuli Good. Thanks for having me on, Ryan.
Ryan Nielsen This is actually from a blog post that
I was telling you off air that I read in 2019, and it left an impression on me. This is really
an opportunity to dive into the mental model of The Wealth Ladder, which I think is really
important for bankless listeners to get inside of their heads. It's incredibly useful as they're
going through this path of kind of building wealth in their own life. Let me just start
with a question, though. How did you learn personal finance and wealth management in general?
Nick Medjuli I just spent a lot of time reading books,
reading blog posts. I was very curious about it, and so I just read a lot on it, crunched a lot
of data on it, and started writing about it. I think actually writing about it helped me more
than anything because that's when I really discovered, oh, here's my opinion on this.
Is that correct? You have to go through that process a lot and find research and do all that.
It's a lot easier now with AI to help with finding datasets and things like that,
but still, it's been a journey. Ryan Nielsen
Do you think that's how people should learn it? Basically, learn by doing mentality? It strikes
me that there's only so much you can get out of maybe a class you take on wealth management.
Investing in wealth management really feels like it's something that has to be
practiced. Also, you have to learn through your mistakes over the years.
Nick Medjuli Yeah, exactly. With investing in particular,
the good thing is we've had some of these markets. We had 2020, we had 2022, these markets that were
down years. Seeing how you reacted during those periods is going to be very helpful for how you
might react in the future, et cetera. Ryan Nielsen
This is why I actually think that we have a crypto audience here, too. I actually think that
crypto offers a rare opportunity for these lessons to come at you at about 3 to 5X speed
versus the normal market because there's such insane volatility. You can make mistakes very
quickly within the crypto asset class, that's for sure. Let's talk about the wealth ladder
concept. I want to maybe split this conversation into two pieces. This is a really simple mental
model for understanding personal finance. We've actually got it on the screen. I want you to help
describe, to unlock this mental model for the bankless audience, and then we can talk a little
bit more about what we can actually do with this mental model once we have it unlocked.
But maybe you could take us from the top. What is the wealth ladder? What are we looking at right
now? Nick Medjuli
The wealth ladder is this idea that your financial strategy should change over time. That's the
overarching message. But within that, there are six distinct wealth levels, which are based on
your net worth. That's all your assets minus all your liabilities. You can think of everything you
own, cash, crypto, cars, stock, money in your bank account, minus any mortgage debt, credit card debt,
student loans, etc. You net those out and hopefully you have a large positive number. That's the
net worth. Once you have your net worth, you're in one of the six wealth levels. Level one is less
than $10,000 in wealth. Level two is $10,000 to $100,000. Level three is $100,000 to $1 million.
Level four is $1 million to $10 million. Level five is $10 million to $100 million. Level six
is over $100 million. The nice thing about this wealth level framework is that you just have to
memorize one of the levels and you can just back out the rest by either dividing by 10 or multiplying
by 10. I always say memorize level three, which is $100,000 to $1 million, because that's the
middle class in the United States. About 40% of US households are in that wealth level across the
entire US. If you just remember, hey, that's level three, then you can say, okay, level two is divided
by 10, so it's $10,000 to $100,000. Then level four is $1 million to $10 million. From that,
you have an idea of, hey, these are different wealth levels. These represent generally pretty
large lifestyle changes and they also represent different economic classes in America. 20% of
households are in level one. 20% roughly are in level two. As I just said, there's 40% in level
three. You have about 18% of households in level four. That's been a big change over recent years,
so there's more millionaires than ever. Then the top 2% are in level five and six. Most of that's
going to be in level five. There's only 11,000 households in level six in the United States,
which is over $100 million. It's a very extreme amount of wealth.
Okay, so we have a 10K, maybe that's just starting out. Then we have $100,000,
which is a threshold. That's stage two. Then we have becoming a millionaire, essentially,
which feels like a big milestone for a lot of people when it comes to wealth. Then we have
becoming a deca millionaire, so that's $10 million above. Then we have centimillionaire,
okay? It seems to kind of, obviously, it thins out as you get to those higher rungs of the latter,
but these are the six rungs of the latter here. Why are we doing 10X scales here? Why are we going
from 10K to 100K, 100K to a million? Why is this logarithmic? I think because a lot of the data
suggests that these are the amount of wealth changes you need to see, a lifestyle change to
see an increase in happiness. There's a lot of data that shows this. It's not just happiness
increases linearly with wealth, but it's like log wealth. For example, if someone had $0 and you
gave them 10,000, they would probably be pretty happy. Oh my gosh, I can breathe easy. I don't
have stress. If I give $10,000 to someone with a million bucks, I promise you they are not going
to have the same elation, right? Even though $10,000 is $10,000, right? But it's just not going
to move the needle for much. I bet the person with a million bucks would still be happy and very
thankful, but they won't feel the same elation and joy. Oh my gosh, my life feels changed as
someone that goes from zero to 10,000. Everyone knows this intrinsically. As you get more money,
it becomes less useful and less impactful on your life. Going from $4 million to $6 million
is less impactful than going from zero to $1 million. Even though $4 to $6 million is a $2
million gain, you're not going to feel that different compared to going from zero to a million.
I think once you start realizing that, you can come up with a framework like this. That's where
the framework was derived from. In particular, what you're showing here in this visual,
I came up with a spin because this is the wealth ladder overall. Based on the wealth
ladder, you can make different spending decisions, income decisions, investment decisions, et cetera.
That's what I cover in the book. But what you're showing here is the spending piece a little bit,
which is like, hey, as you move up the wealth ladder, certain spending categories don't matter
as much. By the time you're in level two, you don't have to look at what's the price of my eggs at a
grocery store. You're like, oh, if I want to get the cage-free eggs, I just get the cage-free eggs.
By the time you get to 100,000, you start to go toward a million deeper into level three.
You don't really have to look at prices at a restaurant anymore. You're like, oh, I want
the salmon for $35 instead of a burger for $25. By the way, I'm quoting New York prices for the
record. That might seem crazy, but that's very normal pricing in New York, 25 bucks for a burger.
Once you're in level four, which is one to 10 million, that's where you can start saying,
hey, I'm going to buy a slightly nicer seat on the airplane. Maybe I'm going to get more leg room or
emergency exit row. Eventually, as you get deeper into level four, you can start going first class
and you can stay in nicer hotels, et cetera. That's the idea here with this visual is as you
move through the levels, there's different levels of spending freedom, as I call them.
I have a mathematical formula that describes this a little bit more. This is just a simplification
of that here. It's going to be in the book in a different way.
I like that. It's very useful to think. Let's just maybe go over this. Stage one is nothing,
right? We're really starting at kind of rung two. Paycheck to paycheck is really rung one.
Rung two is $10,000. That's when grocery prices start to matter a little bit less. You're not
feeling as much of that squeeze every time you buy something, price of eggs, as you mentioned,
at the grocery store. The next rung, $100,000, that's when restaurant prices start to matter
less. You could just say, yeah, we go up to restaurant once a week, a couple of times a week,
whatever. You're not feeling the impact of that. It's not like a major decision for you.
Then you start to get to millionaire status and then vacation prices start to matter a lot less.
For if you're $100,000 maybe in terms of net worth, then you have to think very carefully
before you say you travel somewhere else or the country or what your expenses look like on that
side. Millionaires don't worry about that so much. They get to $10 million and home prices
even matter, start to matter less. They get to centimillionaire status and it's like,
what are prices? Nothing really matters. That's how it scales up and it scales up in a log type
way. I'm interested too that you draw this as kind of a step function. Is it really a step function
or is there some smoothness to the line here? For example, if I have net worth of $90,000,
is it really that much different from $100,000? No, it's not. Of course, this is a step function
to create the ladder effect and kind of create the wealth ladder as a visual, but
it's not like the moment you go over $100,000, your life is transformed. Of course,
that's not true. I think everyone knows that logically. I think it's just a way of thinking
about it in more of a step function. There's more of an idea of, hey, there is a big change
that happens in a certain spot. I think by doing it by orders of 10, it's easier to memorize by
doing this log-based. I don't even say the word logarithm in the entire book. A lot of this is
marketing. Even when people say, oh, the rungs of the wealth ladder, I say no levels, but there's
no levels on the ladder. I agree, but the word rung just doesn't sound as good and people don't
realize that. My first book was called Dollar Cost Averaging. It wouldn't have sold as well
as when it's called Just Keep Buying. People don't realize that and I'm not trying to hate on anyone
who says rung. That's fine if you want to call it that, but I say levels only because people say,
yeah, I'm in level three, I'm in level four. It sounds weird when you just say rung one and rung
two or whatever. Going back to the point here on the pricing, the whole idea behind this,
and there is a logic, it's what is the amount of money you could spend that's trivial? What's
a trivial amount of money? Where I actually got this from, Jay-Z had this lyric. I'm not going
to repeat the exact lyric. I'm just going to paraphrase, but he says, what's 50 grand to
someone like me? Can you please remind me? You've probably all heard the song before, right? Basically,
at the time, his net worth was around 450 million. Let's just say 500 million to be safe.
50 grand to him was 0.01% of his net worth. It was one 10,000th of his net worth. I came up with
this rule called the 0.01% rule. If you take your net worth, you divide by 10,000 and that's how
much money you can spend trivially. It's a small amount of money for you. There's actually an
assumption I've used to go beyond this, which is like, let's just assume very conservatively
that your wealth is generating 0.01% per day. If you do that 365 days a year, that's about
3.7% per year. That is a conservative return. That's treasuries basically. Yeah, everyone's
like treasuries. That's basically what it is. It's like, let's just assume no matter what,
your wealth's going to produce that, right? If we assume that's true, then on average,
you can spend 0.01% of your wealth every single day and your wealth would stay stagnant, right?
All else equal, assuming you have no other spending or anything else. I like using that
0.01% as your marginal spend. Obviously, you have income coming in, you have spending and all that,
but it's that marginal decision that matters. No one is in level two and is like, should I
get a Maserati? No, it's like you're in level two and you're like, do I get a Toyota Camry or
a Toyota Corolla, right? You're making these marginal decisions, right? You're at the grocery
store and you're like, do I get the cage-free eggs or the standard eggs, et cetera. We're all making
marginal decisions based on our income and our wealth and all these things. So I'm saying,
let's use wealth because I think it's a better proxy and it also allows for lifestyle creep.
I think that's the big problem that no one's been able to solve in personal finance is like,
people want to have some lifestyle creep, but they don't want to go overboard. So what's a
good way of balancing that? And I think this is a good balance. It's like, hey, once I'm in level
two, now I can kind of have some lifestyle creep at the grocery store. Once I'm in level three,
I can start to creep at restaurants, et cetera. And that's kind of the thinking behind all of this
is to allow for this kind of a little bit of spending freedom, but only after you built the
wealth. So it's like, hey, you've shown financial discipline. Now you get to have that freedom to
spend more. I think it's better to do that than just be like, oh, well, you've got to raise
of 50 grand. So now you can spend 50 grand more. I don't think that's the way to do it. Or even
saying, oh, you can't spend anything. And so I'm trying to find this balance. And I think wealth
is the way to do that, not income. Okay. So that is the 0.01% spend rule that you talk
about in your book, what you just defined. Can we apply that math in a few places,
just to see if it mentally checks out? Yeah, of course.
If I'm at level two, 0.1% at level two, which is $10,000, what are you saying here?
That's $1. So you just divide by 10,000. So if level two is $10,000 to $100,000,
that means your marginal spend per day is $1 to $10, depending on where you're in there. If
you're a 50,000, it's five bucks a day. Okay. So every, every $1 feels kind of like a lot to me,
right? So I'm like, I'm like looking at coupons. I'm looking at discounts, that kind of thing
at that, that second run. Is that right? Yeah. Well, so I would say $1 is not a lot to you
anymore. If you're below 10,000, I would say it is, but once you get to $10,001, not a lot.
By the time you get to $100,000, $10 isn't a lot. Basically I'm saying that is the amount that I'm
considered trivial. If it's above that amount. I mean, of course we're now cutting hairs here
is $1 or one cent to, you know what I'm saying? I'm not trying to get there, but
these are general. Yeah, there's a rule of thumb. So it's like in general. So for example,
if you're, if you hit a million dollars in your portfolio, I would say $100 is trivial to you.
That's what I would say. Cause you take a million divide by 10,000, that's a hundred, right?
So that's my argument is what take your net worth divide by 10,000. That's the number of
daily spend that is trivial to you, right? If you drop daily spend, I see daily. And so I'm
saying daily on just like this, like marginal daily additional spend. Cause obviously like
you have rent, you have food, you have to buy and all that stuff. But it's like,
you're making spending decisions on the margin. No one is going out and just redoing their spending
every day. It's like, you have kind of general spending decisions you've already made based on
your income. It's that marginal decision. Oh, can I buy this thing? Can I buy my latte? Well,
my argument is let's, why don't we use this rule and figure that out? That's kind of a better way
of doing it. Okay. So going up the ladder gives you essentially some spending freedom for larger
and larger purchases, but they're also reined in, right? You don't have to go crazy. You can
observe the 0.01% rule and basically, you know, like I guess quantify how big of a spending
purchase it is to you individually based on this. Why are we doing wealth instead of income here?
Cause income's fickle. Like in any, like people get raises all the time and then they get laid
off. And it's like going to zero is, imagine if you're going out and signing up for things,
I know for subscriptions, all these other things. And then it's like, Oh, my income goes to zero.
That income's far more variable than wealth is unfortunately. And yeah, wealth can fluctuate.
Obviously it will, it depends how your wealth's invested. If you're invested a hundred percent
crypto, I bet your wealth's a little bit more, a little bit more variable, a little bit more
volatile than your income is. I think that's fair. But for most people in the United States,
based on their general allocations, wealth is far more stable than income is, right?
Cause a lot of people own primary residents, they have bonds, they have stocks, they have
all these other things that usually as volatile stocks are over long periods of time, they're not
as bad, right? And so there can go through periods of high volatility, but in general,
there's some staying power there. So I think the idea here is like income is fickle. You shouldn't
spend based on your income and anyone who spends based on their income, they usually are not in a
great position in the long-term thing about an athlete. Like I'm making 5 million a year. Why
can't I spend, you know, after tax, let's say they take on 2.5, why can't I spend, you know,
2 million? You know, you could, I am agreeing you could, you're still saving 500K a year, but
let's say you get injured in year two. Now you saved a million bucks. That's great. That's
better than most Americans are going to do it. But if you can't get another job after that,
you're in a tough spot now, right? And well, it's actually going to be worse because you're
spending 2 million a year to cut your spending dramatically. You're only going to have half a
year of spending saved, you know, by the time you lose your income. So I think income is not the way
to do this. I think you have to, you know, the marginal decision is spend on wealth. Of course,
income matters. Everyone spends based on income. That's true. But when you're thinking about like,
can I splurge? Can I kind of do a little bit more? Do that based on wealth.
So this, this principle kind of in viewing it like this keeps kind of that lifestyle
inflation in check, particularly when you're looking at in terms of wealth rather than,
rather than income. There's another element to this chart that's actually not in here,
right? So we've got the different levels of wealth based on these kind of numbers,
you know, like net worth numbers. But what about like age, how old someone is, or what about time
as a variable here? Because you know, the concept of like sort of when you're in your 20s, you're
sort of a, you know, a time billionaire concept because you have, you know, billions of seconds
left to live. I mean, if it, if it takes until you're, let's say, I don't know, in your, in
your late 70s to get to millionaire status, that seems to be kind of a factor as you know, in terms
of thinking about your, your wealth ladder and planning your wealth. How does, how does time come
in as a variable to this mental model? So time definitely impacts wealth accumulation.
There's no debate there. If you just look at like the median age in each level, it just goes up
over time because it generally takes time to earn money, save money, build a business,
et cetera, to build wealth. I think the, the time element is actually very interesting. So I don't
think it's as strong on the spending side as you might think. For example, let's say I got to
level four at age 80, right? Now let's assume I have 10 years left. Of course, that's a, you know,
who knows how long, you know, what's the actual average, but as an, as an 80 year old male,
you probably don't even have 10 years left. So according to the actual tables, five million bucks,
I probably have even more spending freedom than someone who's 60 with a million, because I probably
I have less time left. So I could spend more in theory. So as much as the person who's 20 years
old with a million dollars, if they never work again, they don't have that much vacation freedom
on the flip side. Person who's 80 with a million dollars actually has even more vacation freedom
because they don't have as much time where they have to support themselves. So it's really about
your goals and your liabilities. Like who do I have to support? How much money do I want to leave
behind? There's a lot more to this, but I think the time element isn't as important in terms of
the spending piece, right? If you're younger and you have more, that's great. I think in general,
that shouldn't matter as much though. I think that the thing that matters more though is how is your
net worth comprised. So on this chart, it says liquid net worth. That is something I bring up.
So in general, in the wealth ladder, I, everything I do is based on overall net worth, but I think
when it comes to spending, you have to kind of use liquid net worth because you could be like,
I have a home that's worth $300,000 and I have, you know, five grand in my bank account. Does that
mean I have like really deep restaurant freedom? I would say no. I mean, you know, that you have
the net worth to be in level three, but you can't access that equity without a key lock or something
and like, you know, home equity line of credit or something like that. So I would say the conservative
thing to do is spend based on your liquid net worth. So take out any sort of home equity and
then take out, you can even, if you want to, you can take our retirement accounts. Some people do,
some don't. There's debates to be had about that because retirement accounts are basically
like future wealth. The numbers you implied earlier, it can give us some of the stats again
at these different stages. So what percentage of the U S population is say a hundred thousand
versus a million versus 10 million versus a hundred million again? Yeah. So 20% is in level one.
That's less than 10,000. These are us households by the way. Right. And these are approximated.
The exact numbers are in the book. I just want to make it easy to memorize. So 20% are in level two.
That's 10,000 to a hundred thousand. 40% are in level three. That's 100,000 to a million. That's
basically like your middle class in the United States. 18% are in level four. That's 1 million
to 10 million. That's what I would call the upper middle class. Obviously depends where you live.
I think if you have 8 million bucks in your, you know, in a low cost of living area, you're
definitely upper class, but in a place like New York, I would say that's upper middle class still.
And then 10 million to a hundred million, that's going to be like, let's just say 1.9%.
And then over a hundred million is a 0.1%. It's actually much lower than that. But
I just say the top 2% is level five and six. And this is going to skew older as well. Right. So
of course. Yeah. Larger quantity of 60 year olds that might be in those
upper levels rather you're like versus like 20 and 30 year olds. I can actually have
age data in here. So. Well, I'm trying to think of this podcast probably skews towards 20s,
late 20s, 30s, some 40s. Apologies to all of our older listeners, but I think that is the bulk
of this podcast, let's say. So, cause I think people as they're listening to this, Nick,
what they're obviously doing is they're thinking through, okay, what level am I?
You know, and so let's give them a sense for that, for their age adjusted.
So this is on page 150 of the book and it has a table, which has like on the rows,
it has your household age, right? So it says 20 to 29, 30 to 39, et cetera. And then it has the
levels and it breaks out the percentage in each one. So for example, let's just go through 20 to
29 year olds. These are the percentages in the 12th level. So 20 to 29 level one is about 40%. So
it's two times what the actual overall is. Paycheck to paycheck again. Paycheck to paycheck is
that's about 40% of people in their twenties are in level one, right? About 36% are in level two.
Okay. 24% are in level three. That's, that's a hundred thousand to a million. So that's why
we call them middle-class in the United States. One percent, only one percent are in level four,
which is 1 million to 10 million. So only 1% of people in their twenties are millionaires.
A lot of 20 year olds just breathe a sigh of relief and they're saying, oh, thank God I'm
not behind Nick. Yeah. And then obviously level five and six, it's less than a percent. I don't
even know what it is. And once again, the data there is not as good at figuring this type of stuff
out. Especially if you're, once you slice it to be incredibly young and that there's going to be just
not that many people like Mark Zuckerberg was one of those people. Like there's just not a lot in
that category. Okay. Now we can do the thirties. And for those in their thirties, level one is
about 22%. Level two is about 28%. Level three, this is the vast majority at 45%. So that's,
you know, a hundred thousand to a million middle-class once again, and a level four,
1 million to 10 million. That's about 5%. So only about 5% of people, even in their thirties,
make it into level four. So I know we like to, you know, the media proclaims, oh, look at all these
young rich millionaires and stuff. Those people are very rare. Even in their thirties, only one
in 20 people in their thirties are in the United States are going to be in level four, right? And
then obviously we can go up from there, but the data is broken out, you know? And then even by the
time you get to your sixties, you know, in level four, one in four, you know, people in their sixties
are in level four, but that's it. You had time to save money, build wealth, you know, all that stuff.
HOFFMAN Is what you just quoted, is all that liquid net worth or is that also?
NICHOLAS No, this is overall net worth. This is not liquid. I'm sorry. This is overall net worth.
HOFFMAN So that includes the house as well.
NICHOLAS The house, retirement account, everything, your whole net worth.
HOFFMAN This implies, of course, that it gets, each level gets harder as you go. I mean,
there's definitely a thinning out type of effect. I think, I feel like we know the reasons why it
gets harder, but there are also some reasons why it could kind of get easier, which is like,
you know, the eighth wonder of the world compound returns, of course, where if you have
a lot of wealth, it's easier to compound those gains and trade a lot of wealth. But just generally,
is that the case that people should expect that each of these levels will get exponentially
harder, maybe a 10X harder, maybe not quite that much, but more difficult?
NICHOLAS It depends. I mean, it really depends on where you start your trajectory, everything. Like,
most people even, you know, let's say you graduate from college, had a degree or something.
I would say you're probably not in level one unless you really grew up like very poor. Most
of you probably through family and network and stuff, you're kind of in level two, even though
your net worth isn't above 10K, but you have intangibles that I would value it around that
amount. I would say I was never in level one, even though I didn't grow up with much money.
My parents declared bankruptcy twice before I was 18, but because of other family and other people
that had assets and stuff, I don't think I was ever close to being on the streets or something
like that. So it's really, remember, it's a gray area, but I think thinking of it in this way is
very helpful. So in terms of like, well, what's the hardest level to jump in or out of? I don't
know the exact answer. I'm pretty confident though that it's, you know, level four going to level
five is basically, and I don't want to say impossible, but the tactics to get out of level
four and into level five are very different than the tactics you use to get into level four.
Right. And so if I had to pick like which one's the hardest to break out of, I would say that one.
I don't have a ton of data on this. I just have like the switching matrix of like, okay. And this,
once again, this isn't chapter 10 in the book. It's like, Hey, let's say you started in level
one. What's the percentage you're going to be in level, what percentage of households were in level
one after 10 years or after level two, after 10 years or level three, right?
And so you can kind of see the switching matrix. And then I do it again after 20 years. So I'm
trying to show over long periods of time, what's the probability of households changing wealth
levels over time. And this is based on some data from the university of Michigan called the panel
study of income dynamics. And they followed the same households over time. So a lot of the wealth
data is just snapshots over time of the entire, you know, American household population. This was
the same household. So we could actually see when people built wealth, kind of what differences they
had, et cetera. And then I put a lot of that into the book. So this is part of the benefit. Maybe
we're starting to get to some of the application of the wealth ladder as a mental model. I think we
have the basis of the mental model, but the application of it is you can chart yourself
on the wealth ladder somewhere in each of these levels. And then there's a different strategy
for each level to get to the next level, right? At level one, you're not going to use the same
strategies as, you know, going from level three to four. So can you talk about maybe some of these
levels individually? Because people, by now in the conversation, I think they've placed themselves.
They're probably like, okay, I see it. I'm level two right now. I'm working to get to level three.
You know, maybe we could talk about some of those levels individually and what you advise
as to the strategies of how people, you know, kind of climb from one level to another. Maybe we should
start with, let's just start with level one. If you're doing paycheck to paycheck, I don't know
what portion of the bankless listeners are there. But, you know, what should you do?
I think the most important thing in level one is establishing some form of safety. And that can be
and that can be financial emergency fund. People have probably heard that before.
It can also be non-financial. It's like, what relationships do you have that you can rely on
if you got into a tough spot financially? And the reason I bring this up, every level of the
wealth ladder, something is being amplified. And you don't know what it is, but in level one,
it's bad luck. And what do I mean by that? Interesting. Let's say you have a car,
your tire blows out. If you're in level three or four, that's an annoyance. Oh crap, my tire went
out. I have to call AAA or have to do this thing. I got to go take it to the shop. Whatever it is,
you got to just do this annoying thing. You have the money, you're going to get it fixed. Obviously
it's not going to really impact your life. It's just going to impact you that day.
Someone in level one, if that happens and they don't have money, they don't have credit,
they don't have any way of fixing that. They may not get to work. If they don't get to work,
they could get fired. If they get fired, they can go in a credit card debt, right? You can just see
how a simple annoyance for someone in let's say level three or four can be a massive, you know,
wreck their life for months. Yeah, it could be if they could get into a financial tailspin. And
if you look at the data on like people that get into like, you know, financial distress events,
delinquencies, bankruptcy, et cetera, you know, 50% of those events are experienced by just 10%
of the population. So it's a very small percentage of people that get caught in these traps and they
just never get out. Now, of course, some of that's behavioral. They're just, they just make bad
decisions. They never make good decisions. That's some people, but I believe there's a good portion
of the population in that sector that just, they had, they got unlucky once and then they just fell
into a pit and it was, it was really, really difficult to get out. So the goal is to not fall
into that pit in the first place. And how do we do that? We try and build some sort of redundancy
safety in our personal lives, with relationships, with financial, whatever, just to get to level
two. Cause by the time you're in level two, you can breathe a little bit easier having just a,
you hear about what happened with during COVID, when people got these COVID checks and, you know,
I saw so much stuff on Twitter and interviewing people and articles of like, Oh my gosh, I've
never like had to worry about where my next meal's coming from. And, you know, anymore, I don't have
to do that anymore. Cause I got this check and right. And that little feeling of relief, it's,
by the time you get to five, 10 grand, you're going to be having even more of that. And you can kind
of chill out of it. And so I think that's incredibly important in level one. That's got to feel like a
great jump going from level one to level two for the first time for a lot of folks.
It's the most important jump. It's the most important jump without a doubt, because that's
where you can say, Hey, I don't need to, my basic safety. You know, you think about Maslow's hierarchy
of needs, your basic safety is kind of taken care of. That doesn't mean you're a step for life. That
doesn't, there's a whole list of other financial woes you can have, but you know, where am I going
to sleep and where am I going to eat? Those can be covered at with, with 10 grand.
All right. Let's get to level two. So someone who's in level two somewhere, somewhere between
10 K and a hundred K, what's your best advice for them? So I think there's two types of people
in level two. There's people who are on their way to like level three and four, and they just need
time. They're just there. They got the education. There may be very, these are usually just young
people. Maybe they graduated from university. They got a good job and they're like, they just
started saving. And their only issue is they just need time. Right. And they're doing what you advise.
They've already done everything. Yeah. They're buying, they're investing in assets. Great.
They're just, they just need time. Right. If you're like 22, like I'm only 22. I don't have
a hundred thousand dollars. Like just to give it time. If you're doing the things, if you have a
good income, you're saving money, you're investing, just give it time. Right. Then there's another
group who I would say their income isn't as high. Maybe they're a little bit older. They've been
saving a little bit here and there. Maybe they have a 401k, you know, maybe they own a home and
they're just, you know, and they've been paying into, it's not a super expensive home. And their
issue is probably their income's not high enough. And my guess is that's because they're in a job
that doesn't pay as well. And that might be because they don't have an education to get a higher paying
job, or they don't have the skills to do other types of jobs that pay more. So everything I
focus on a level two is like education, but ultimately to get to income. Right. So it's like
whatever skills you can build and whether that's, you know, you can go to a trade school, you can do
coding, there's all these different skills that can have benefits, especially if you're in level
two and you don't have that background that I think can pay off in the future. And I think that's
what I focus on level two is like education, get skills, like, because once you can change that
trajectory, that's how, you know, you got to put a wedge between your income and your spending.
And I don't think you should keep putting downward pressure on your spending because you can only cut
so much. So the real solution is just raise your income. Of course, that's not easy. That takes
years of time, practice, dedication, et cetera, to build the skills to get there.
So level two to three is really about investing yourself.
I would say education for, for those people that just don't need the time. I think there's people
like, for example, I got into level, I was, I would say when I graduated college, I was in level two.
I did not have over 10, I had under $10,000, but given my education, everything on my balance sheet,
I would say I was, I had over $10,000 in wealth and I just needed time to get into level three,
et cetera. And so I think that was my thinking at the time. And I think that's still accurate.
So I think a lot of people in level two, that's, that's their situation for those that are like,
I didn't get an education. I don't necessarily have amazing skills. You got to find, make that
gap so that you can get on the right path. So you're going to end up being in level three,
level four, and make sure you're doing the good investment practices, which is like being patient
dollar cost averaging into high quality assets. Like that, that just goes without saying,
does it not? Yeah. I mean, it's true in level two, but it's, it's even more true in level three.
I guess this is a good segue to get into that. Yeah. Three to four. Yeah. So the big, and every,
every chapter, every level has a strategy, right? And so in, in, in level three, that is just keep
buying, which actually was, you know, the name of my first book, but I fundamentally believe that is
the strategy for people like, Hey, I'm in that kind of a hundred K to a million range. What do I do to
get to a one to 10 million? Well, you got to, you know, the continual purchase of a diverse set of
income producing assets. That is the mantra from just keep buying. And it's also included in the
wealth ladder. And I believe that is the way to do it. And there's three pieces of that. The continual
purchase means you're, you know, just keep buying. You're buying over time of a diverse set. I really
believe in diversification. I'm sorry, diversification deeply. And I mean that across like so many things,
like I own crypto. I'm not a big crypto investor. I've never been in the space deeply, but I've owned
crypto and I'm going to continue to hold it. And it's a small percentage of my allocation. It's only
been about 2% of my net worth, but it's been about 2% of my net worth since 2018. And so
luckily I haven't actually had to buy too much more because my wealth's increasing, but the crypto
prices keep increasing as much. So I've only had to, I've had to sell once because it went too high.
And so I had to sell it a little to kind of rebalance, but it's staying about 2%. So even
as you know, Bitcoin's cranking and you know, my wealth is increasing. So it's staying in my kind
of right range. And if it goes too low, I will buy more of it. If it goes too high, I sell it.
And I'm very disciplined. I follow those rules. Yes, would it have been better if I put every
dollar I own into Bitcoin? Of course, but I don't think I would have been able to hold through all
the madness that happened. And I think that's more important in terms of wealth building than just
like trying to maximize a number. So that's the next thing, right? Diversification. And then of
income producing assets. So as I said, for the most part, I own income producing assets at stocks,
bonds, you know, real estate, you know, farmland, all those different types of things are, you know,
small business. I've done some small private investments. And so in general, that's kind of
where I focus my time and energy in my investment portfolio. So the non-income producing is about
5%. But it can be more. I mean, I don't, I don't know what the right range is. I say non-income
producing like gold, wine, art, crypto, et cetera, can be up to 15%. But it's really up to you. Some
people have a lot more in crypto and that's fine. But the volatility for me is a bit much.
Where do people screw up from three to four? Like what are the common pitfalls when they're
going from a hundred thousand to a million? I think the thing that there's two things that
can prevent them from getting to a million. And I think one of those is they don't have a high
enough income. Like if they get into level three, like a little bit later, like late in their career,
and if their income just isn't high enough, it's just, there's not enough momentum there,
even with investing to get out of level three. So I think income's one piece of it. But the
other thing I see is generally in the data, when you look at the households that start in level three
and get to level four and compare them to the households that start in level three and stay
in level three after a decade, right? So we're comparing three to four versus three to three
after 10 years. There's two differences. Those that got to four had a higher starting income.
So that's one of them. That's important. But the other thing is those that stayed in level three
spent almost as much money as the people that made it to level four. So it's like,
wow, they aren't making as much as the people that eventually make it to four at the beginning
of the period, but they're spending almost as much. So it really is that lifestyle inflation.
Keeping up with the Joneses. And I think it's mostly, if I'm being honest, it's mostly showing
up in real estate because that's the biggest line item for most people. It's like you're paying to
be in a certain area or you really have a high mortgage or something and that's causing it.
And if you actually look at how those in level three, like what was their asset breakdown,
the vast majority of their wealth is going to be home equity. It's going to be in their home.
And so this is covered in chapter three of the book. So yeah, so among those that are actually
homeowners in level three, over 60% of their assets is in their home. So you took their entire balance
sheet, 60%. And in level two, it's like 70%. So the first three levels, those people that actually
own homes, it's the vast majority of their assets. After that, once you go into level four and beyond,
it drops quite a bit because those people tend to have a lot of other income producing assets that
actually produce money for them versus a home which doesn't necessarily kick off income.
Anthony Comegna I want to talk about four to five next,
which is one million to a decade millionaire status. But before, maybe it's worth pausing
because the bulk of the audience listening will probably find themselves in the first three levels
that we mentioned quite obviously. I think maybe I have a question for you about how this looks now
versus how it looked, say 30, 40 years ago. So there's generally somebody growing up in their
20s or 30s. I'm not sure. How old are you, Nick? So you're 35. Okay. So you're a millennial, right?
So things have felt like they've gotten harder for younger generations. And maybe some of the
millennials have kind of like, I would say on the other side of this, they've made it, maybe they had
a house and they've enjoyed asset price and, you know, inflation over the last 10 years or so.
They've done what you've advised and they've invested in capital assets and they're doing
quite well on them. They've got crypto, then they've done quite well on that.
But there are a lot of people who feel like they're growing up in a world where just
asset prices have gotten away from them. I think where we see this most is home prices.
How expensive is it for you just to get a home if you're in your 20s and you're just starting
up? I guess the meta question here is, has this wealth ladder gotten harder for newer generations?
At some level, this is kind of a ladder of the American dream, isn't it? And the American
dream for a lot of people does feel like it's out of sight. Do you see that as you're looking
at the data and you're advising folks on personal finance? So it's definitely gotten harder on the
housing piece. There's no debate there. I think when we talk about the American dream,
I think the American dream has also changed over time. I think it's not the same American
dream. For example, houses are so much larger than they used to be. If you look at price per
square foot, that has gone up since COVID, but, you know, before COVID, like that was basically
flat for like over 20 years. Price per square foot had not changed. It was only since COVID
that it's actually started to go up. And so what that means is people are like, oh, is the American
dream still around? It's like, we're just building bigger and bigger houses and people have to pay
the same price per square foot to get the, you know, inflation adjusted price per square foot
to get a bigger and bigger house. Where that came from, I don't know, when did the American dream
become a much bigger home? I don't know how that happened, but that started to happen. So
we're not really comparing apples and apples. The other thing too is like so many people travel
more. Like when I talked to my parents, like, oh, what did you guys do when you were growing up?
Did you guys like fly to Europe and go on airplanes? It's like not even about money. It's like
so many people didn't travel and now there's so many more people traveling and people that I would
say are not necessarily super wealthy because they prioritize those things more. So I know the housing
market is messed up, but we have a different, we're buying a different basket of goods today
than we used to buy, right? I think healthcare is even worse than the housing market, but that's a
whole separate discussion. So when I'm thinking about this and like you're saying, oh, is it harder
or easier? It's definitely harder and it's harder for a few reasons. It's just, there's more
competition out there today. Let's go back to 1950. Let's make it super easy. Back then,
and of course there's a lot of discrimination and things related to this in the United States,
but if you were a man and it was 1950, you only had to compete with other American men and generally
white men. I mean, of course there was a labor market for black men as well, but it wasn't
as equal as it is today or more equal, right? And we didn't have the Civil Rights Act,
all that type of stuff. So think about your competition then. And then women enter the
workforce. So now you don't just got to compete against half the population and have maybe a
slight advantage over one group of people. Now you have to compete with all these other people.
And that was just the US. And so it got tougher then. And then guess what? Now we have globalization.
So now you're not just competing against people in the US and just men and just white men or
whatever. Now you're competing against people all over the world to do your job. And so people are
wondering like, well, why are asset prices going up? Why is all this happening? Like there's money
coming in from all over the place. There's so many apartments in New York City that are bought out by
people in Asia and that just buy the apartment. They don't even live there. And they have it as
like another, a safe haven for their wealth, right? They don't want to just have it all like in China
or they don't want to all have it in Japan or wherever. And so when you start thinking about
this in that way, you're like, oh, wow, it does make sense why the competition is getting harder
because there are more competitors than we used to have. And that is an unfortunate truth, but it is
the truth, right? There is money coming in from other places that is bidding up asset prices
across the board. And that is causing some of this. It's not the whole explanation, but
if you think about it logically, it's like, yeah, wouldn't I rather just compete with fewer people?
Yes, I would love to live like that, but that's not the world we live in.
So you are saying, Nick, it is harder. You acknowledge that, but you also seem pretty
optimistic that it's possible. And I guess you believe it's possible. And this is part of the
reason why you've written this book. And I want you to talk to maybe a certain segment of the
audience who just looks at this and it's just like, yeah, sorry, the game is rigged. I'm not
even going to bother playing this whole game. It's just not worth it. Do you feel like people
have a fighting shot at getting to these different levels if they basically do what you're prescribing?
It depends which level. I think five and six is really tough. What is a fighting shot? It's very
difficult to get to five and six. So depending on how you define fighting shot, no. But I do believe
that most people, if they work at it, they can get to level three. And some, if you get it early
enough, you could get to level four. I fundamentally believe that. I don't think everyone's going to get
into level four. I think that's tougher. It also depends. Once again, it depends where you start,
how much... If you start deeply in debt, you kind of don't have a lot of skills and something,
you're in your late 30s, early 40s. I think it's tough to get out of that hole and then get to
level four. I think it's doable, but it's really tough. It really depends on your starting
conditions. That matters a lot too. I don't want to downplay that as well. But yeah, and it also
depends how much you can work. What are your liabilities? If you have like, oh, I already have
two kids I have to take care of and I don't have time to do other things, side hustles, whatever,
then that's going to make it tough. That's going to make it difficult. And there's no way around
that. I can't say, oh, yes, everyone can be a millionaire and perfect and great. No, there's
going to be certain restraints on your life possibly. And you have to figure out what are
you willing to sacrifice? What do you care about? Why do you even want to be a millionaire? I don't
even... I get why people think why they want to be a millionaire, but why do you want to be a
millionaire? So I would think through a lot of those things. Ethereum's layer two universe is

part of what you're saying is it gets somewhat exponentially harder from, you know, like the
upper rungs versus the lower rungs. There's a question people really have to ask themselves,
which is like, do I even want to do this? Like is building the wealth and the way I'm building it
worth missing out on other areas of wealth? You know, so we've talked about this entire episode,
of course, The Wealth Ladder is based on net worth from a financial perspective.
We recently had Sahil Bloom on the podcast. He wrote a book called The Five Types of Wealth.
And it was a fantastic book, really influenced how I think about wealth and net worth. The Wealth
Ladder here is just one element of wealth. He also talks about relationship and social wealth. He
talks about time wealth. He talks about your health. All of these things are a more encompassing
definition of wealth. And so I think there's an element sometimes when people see this chart and
they're just like, if only I can get from like level two to level three, then I'll be happy
and I'll have the life I want or three to four. And that every, I guess, step up of the ladder
feels like it's not maybe fulfilling them in the way that they want to be fulfilled. Maybe you talk
a little bit about that, right? Because once you start to get to, you know, level three, level four,
Sahil Bloom calls this like, maybe you have your enough life and your enough life is basically
sort of a number, some kind of wealth where you can sort of live the life that you want and you're
using your money, but your money is a tool. It doesn't own you. And so maybe reflect on that
for a minute, because I think people seriously need to consider where we get into the upper
levels here, whether they want to proceed or not. Yeah, I think it's a great question. And it's funny
because Sahil and I, he asked for me to collaborate with him on his book. And so I, there's like a
chapter in there that's like based on some of my work. And then I used his framework in my books.
We did like a Jersey swap with Chapters basically. But yeah, I think his approach is correct. You
have to think about these other types of wealth and like how much they matter and thinking through
those and does it matter to keep climbing? And that is the big question. Like what are you willing
to do and sacrifice to move on and give up for what? And what are you doing it for? I think in
certain cases, it does make sense. I think if you're lower on the wealth ladder and you want more
freedom, you want more of the ability to choose what you work on, all those types of things,
I think it does make sense to climb the wealth ladder. The question is where, where do you stop?
And you're right. Is it level three? Is it level four? It depends where you live, your cost of
living. What do you care about? What do you value? All these questions I can't answer for you. You
have to kind of look inside yourself and say, here's the things I really care about. And then
how do I go to get those? I think understanding yourself is far more important than any of these
frameworks or any of this stuff, because if you know what you really want, then you can solve,
right? It's like always solve backwards, figure out the end game and then solve backwards from
there. That's how I like to live life thinking about, okay, what, well, ideally, what would I
like to, what would I like my forties to be like fifties, et cetera? Think through that and then
back out how you might be able to get there. Yeah, I think that's great advice. Maybe another
way to ask this in the meta question is this is a ladder to where? Like where are we arriving
on the other side? Is that different for everybody or like for you, what is this ladder about? What's
on the other side of this? Of course it's different for everybody. It's like, what do you actually
value? And for mine, it's like, I think about time freedom probably the most. And so I solve a
full-time nine to five job. I write on the weekends and obviously I wrote a book too.
So I was like doing that all basically last year. And so I don't have as much time freedom
as I would like and figuring out how do I build that time freedom eventually and what that's
going to look like. And it may not even happen for the next years. I mean, you know, I just got
married and so my wife and I probably start having kids relatively soon. So I know once that happens,
I'm going to have to move something around in my life. Does that mean I blog less often? Does that
mean I, you know, I take a different role at my firm? I have no idea, but at some point in the
future, I'm going to get to a point where I'm like, Hey, I need to move things around to have
more time for my family and things like that. And so I know that's coming and I'm anticipating that,
which is why I'm kind of getting ahead of it now. But I think you have to think through what are
the things you care about and how do you want to optimize those things? So with those caveats aside,
we left folks at, I think level, level four here. So let's talk to those, those mountain climbers
who want to go scale Mount Everest and keep going to the top here. So from level four to five,
this is the difference from a million to 10 million. What does that look like? What's your
advice for those folks? If you want to go past 10 million AKA level five, you have to completely
change your strategy. Unlike everything so far in the wealth ladder, like, you know, going from
level three to level four is usually just like having a higher paying job and just being able
to save more and invest well. And, you know, you just give it time and that's a lot of it too,
like time's a piece of it. The difference between, you know, level four and level five is not just
time. And I can just give you an example. Let's say you're, you have a million dollar portfolio.
I'm just trying to make it very easy. You just got to level four. It's earning 5% a year inflation
adjusted. So let's say it could relatively conservative annual return and you're saving
a hundred thousand dollars a year. Do you know how long it would take you to get to level five
to 10 million? The answer is 28 years. And that's after you got to a million dollars, right? So like
you already made it there. You got this money, all this stuff, and still it takes you another three
decades of grinding and saving a hundred thousand dollars a year, right? So once you start to do the
math on this, you realize like, Oh my gosh, like there's just like no way I'm going to get there
by doing this standard, you know, have a good job, save money, invest, you know, in income producing
assets. It's just not going to happen, right? On an inflation adjusted basis. So how do people do
it besides like celebrities, athletes, entertainers that, you know, end up getting paid, you know,
tons of money in these huge contracts, besides those people that get paid a lot for their labor,
it's basically all entrepreneurship. And so they, they found a business and they sell it for tens of
millions of dollars, or they started a startup and that thing sells for hundreds of millions
or even billions of dollars. And so once you net it all out, they end up with over $10 million,
basically. And so that's basically the only path up. So the question for someone in level four is,
do you want to go and start a business and go down this road of doing all this crazy stuff
just to get to over 10 million? Or do you want to say, Hey, maybe I don't need to, I can take my
foot off the gas and I don't need to really do any of that. And that's where this whole idea of
coast fire, just like, you know, financial independence retire early. That's the fire
movement, but coast is like, Hey, I've saved up enough for my retirement. So I won't have to worry
about that. And I just need a coast until I get there. I have enough assets now where I can,
if I can just cover my current living, I don't need to save any more money. I just need to cover
my current expenses all the way until I retire. And my assets that I currently have are going to
grow enough to a point that by the time I hit retirement, they are enough to sustain me through
my retirement. So it's a different way of looking at it. And I think there's going to be a lot of
people who are in level four, who are busting their, their, but let's say to make, make more
money, save, grind all that crap. And they're going to look at it and say, why am I doing this? Like,
it doesn't even make an impact anymore. Like I'm going to just do the math as well. A million
dollars, you're saving a hundred K a year. That's impacting your wealth by 10% a year, right?
A hundred thousand over a million is 10%. By the time you get to $5 million at 100K is only
2% of your wealth. It doesn't move the needle anymore. Right. And so you have to decide like,
why am I doing all of this for this amount of money? When, you know, my, my assets alone
will probably earn more than I do. So it's like, you get into this spot in level four,
where there's like a no man's land. And if you actually look at the data, the hardest level to
break out of over a 20 year period is level four. Most people that are, that get into level four,
20 years later, they're still there. They do not break out of that level. Cause it's just a
completely different game to get out of there. And also maybe that's partially by design. Maybe
some people just decide not to like, I think that's good. They shouldn't. I agree. They shouldn't. I
think most people rationally should say, Hey, why am I doing all this? It doesn't make sense.
Well, we're at it like since because once you're at, once you're at four and you're looking at
five, you're probably got enough for retirement. You're getting pretty close there. What do you
think about retirement? You think that's a, like an overrated concept or do you like the idea?
It depends how you define retirement, right? I think if you define retirement is like, Oh,
I'm just going to be on a beach all day. Some people, most people I think would not enjoy that.
Some people do love that and they just chill out and they don't care. But I think the good,
I'd say the vast majority of people need something beyond just consumption. And like,
you're like, what's your purpose? Right. And I've had people write to me about this when I write
about fire stuff and they tell me like, you know, I retired early. I did this, but it's like,
I just feel like I'm just going place to place waiting to die. I'm just partying up with all
these random people. I'll never see again having a good time, but I'm just like, and it's dark,
dude. It's dark. Some of the stuff people have told me. And of course that's not every person
on fire. I don't want to say that. I want to paint a bad brushstroke over the whole movement. I just
think there are people out there where it's like, what's your purpose? If you don't have that thing
you're doing, or I know I want to do this thing, it can be really tough. And this has nothing to
even do with fire. This is just true of retirement in general. It's a lot of people
that their whole life is their job. They leave and then they have an existential crisis. They
don't know what to do next. They're like, they're sitting there and they, you know,
they're watching CNN or Fox news all day. It's like, that's not an ideal retirement for most
people. And so because of that, I think that's something else to think about. So before, you
know, what I like to say is, you know, before you know what you want to retire from, make sure you
know what you want to retire to. Right. And that's the big idea.
Tanner Iskra Yeah. I think you said it earlier in the podcast where your big thing is like,
it's time freedom. I mean, the wealth piece is the ability to buy yourself time freedom. And then
you have the ability to work on whatever you want. You don't have to be at a specific meeting at a
specific time or show up at a day job. You get to pick and then it's up to you what you decide to
invest in. But for most people, most of the time, I think you're right. It's not about just like
going on a beach and, I don't know, living in a permanent state of vacation, right? It's like,
humans, I mean, we desire like, we need purpose. We need something to strive for. We need to like
work and have output. So I think a lot of people resonate with that. Let's talk about the, this
last rung here or level, let's say. This is the 10 million to 100 million. I'm not sure what fraction
of the bankless audience is game to go try this, but what does it take at the highest levels here?
So, I mean, to build more wealth, you just have to, if you have a business you're going to sell,
you got to just sell a bigger business. And the truth though is most people that made it past,
let's say 100 million, they usually don't make it there on their first business, right? And I
give plenty of examples in the book, but you can think of, you know, Elon Musk, his first business
was not PayPal, which that made him a lot of money. He had something before that, right?
Most people have a business before that they sell, make a little, make some money off,
and then they use that and their resources there to really go in on the next one. Even like Mark
Cuban, you know, he sold whatever broadcast.com in like the late nineties during the bubble.
And then he used that to propel himself up further, right? And so a lot of this is just,
you know, do you want to keep doing that? And a lot of it's protection. How do you protect your
wealth? So I think the strategy and the discussion is very different once you're in level five,
because it's like, what are you trying to do? What's your actual goals? Why are you grinding
to level six? I mean, and one of the quotes I have in the book is, you know, for some people,
the most expensive thing they own is their ego. And I fundamentally believe that's true. That's
especially true in levels five and six, because at some point you're saying, why are you doing this?
And what's the, you know, and you know, people want to just take money and light it on fire,
over-concentrate, risk it all for what? It's ego, I believe, at the end of the day.
Do you think there's an element of like, maybe to quote another 90s rapper, Biggie, more money,
more problems here? Is it due to these higher levels? Like, is it maybe not? Like, what problems
come at these higher levels? I mean, you were talking about just thinking about how to secure
your wealth, maybe worrying about it all the time. And what are the downsides here?
So that's a piece of his worrying about it. Like, there's tax implications, there's like a state
planning implications that happen in level five that you don't have to worry about as much in
level three or four. There's like, you know, interpersonal things are different, right? If
you just think about like, let's say someone's visiting you for a house party, if they trip and
fall, like, okay, if you're not that rich, they're probably not going to sue you. Obviously, if they
need medical care, okay, you help them out with that, whatever. But if they know you're rich, I
mean, they might take advantage of you, or they may purposefully trip, right? All sorts of things
that wouldn't be, if people know, if your wealth is publicly known, there's now a target on your
back for people to abuse that in a way that doesn't happen for people that are just like,
you know, middle class, upper middle class. And so I think that's something else to think about is
how does that change, you know, your relationship with other people? Like, let's say if, you know,
you happen to be single, you're on the dating market, you'll never, it's going to end at the
back of your mind, you're never going to know does this person actually like me for me or is it for
my money? And so that changes the dating market. Now, it's very ironic that men are, you know,
going out there trying to accomplish all these things and become, you know, rich and famous and
successful and all this. And at the end of the day, that kind of distorts the whole point of dating,
which is you want to find someone who likes you for you. And you've now made that kind of impossible,
right? You've made it very difficult to actually, you have to just test people for a long time to
actually get to know that. So it's ironic that a lot of the things we chase end up harming certain
parts of our lives in other ways. The trade-off is much harder to live a normal life, I guess,
is what you're saying. Yeah, exactly. Once you have extreme wealth and as long as it's publicly known
or it's known, like someone could search it or figure it out. Yeah, no one knows. It's a completely
different story because then you can be like, oh, this person has no idea that I'm worth, you know,
$20 million and they're treating me how they would treat anyone, right? I think that that changes
things. There is a subset of people listening to this episode and people that I met within crypto
that have actually zoomed up this wealth ladder very quickly and maybe in some cases too quickly.
Have you run across that? Like what are the concerns about, you know, going from two to
four, two to five in a hurry? Because that has happened in crypto to a number of people,
maybe not a great number of people, but certainly generational wealth in this fast-paced asset class
can happen very quickly and sometimes I feel like people have no idea what to do with it.
Yeah, I think the big issue is probably concentration and so it's like, you know,
oh, I bought this random altcoin, it went up 10,000X and now I went, you know, level two,
level four, let's say, you know, and did you sell, did you diversify your wealth when you're there?
Maybe some people did, that's great, but a lot of people don't necessarily and if it comes crashing
down, it's a whole other story, right? I had a friend, a close friend out here in New York,
he had five of these monkey NFTs through Solana. He had seven of them.
The board eight club.
Yeah, no, not the board eight ones, they were called like the monkey one, I don't even know.
Oh, they were an alt NFT, so this is really down.
Yeah, they were under Solana, they were under Solana, I think they're under Ethereum,
so they're on a different chain.
You knew a true degen.
Yeah, oh yeah, he got seven of these for 50 bucks each, right, or something like that.
At one point, they were, I think they were worth, his whole portfolio is worth like 1.2 million.
After taxes and everything, he ended up getting 90K out of it, right, because it happened so fast.
He went from like, he was working a minimum wage job, you know, he bought these things,
then all of a sudden he's got 20, 30 grand, then he's got 50, then he's got, and then overnight,
it's like, he went from like 100 grand to 500 grand almost overnight, and he's like,
what's going on here? He sold one of them for like 50, I think, and got some money out,
then the rest kind of all crashed and only got like another, I think 40 out after tax and
everything. So it's like, still, that's incredible. He put in 350 bucks and took out 90 grand.
That's an incredible return, you know, but, and it's hard to know when to sell. It's like,
it's a very difficult problem, but that's an example of someone who kind of jumped through
wealth levels. He went from like level one into, I guess, only the level two, but he went pretty
deep into level two, like basically within, you know, a few months when Solana had his first big
run. And so I don't have a great solution for that. I think it's like diversification and trying to
be prudent, but arguably the people that get those types of returns don't follow the behaviors to
get that. It's almost like a chicken and the egg problem. It's like impossible. Like how can someone
that loves doing these types of risky things just suddenly learn to be risk-averse? It's just not,
generally doesn't happen. And so I can tell people, hey, don't do that. But they're like,
why would I listen to you? You're an idiot. You're the one who takes the safe route to get there.
You know, I'm like, okay, do what you want then. Hey, you know, you never know. I just worry about
people that they got all this money. They did it. It's still on, it's still paper games,
whatever. And then it all comes crashing down. And then what happens next, right? That's,
that's kind of more, that's, I think the bigger tragedy than like, oh, I missed some upside.
You know, I sold, for example, I have this famous tweet where I said, I sold half my Bitcoin. This
was right when it first hit like 52,000. And it was a rebalancing. I was just rebalancing. I know,
I had no idea what the future Bitcoin was going to do, but I said it and people went nuts and said
I was an idiot and all this. And right now they look very right, you know? And it's like, hey,
man, it's over double that. Like I could have held, you know, but I rebalance, I follow my rules and
that's it. Do you find this as a pitfall that throws people off a lot, which is basically
being a little too risky with, you know, going these levels or, I mean, and there seems to be
sort of a plague of like sports betting, for instance, in crypto, this translates to, you know,
degen meme coin trading, maybe, you know, really low market cap stuff. People get addicted to
looking at their crypto wallet, let's say, and seeing these massive gains. Of course,
that can reverse on you, but it almost feels like there are a lot of young people listening that are
kind of in this trap of more of the get rich quick type of scheme. Is that a pitfall when
it comes to the wealth ladder? And what do you say to those people?
I would say definitely is a pitfall, but I understand why they do it. Like if, if you're
looking at, you know, you're saying, Hey, I don't necessarily have an education. I don't have skills
on all this. What's the easiest way? It's not a high probability. What's the easiest way to,
let's say, get to level three or level four. It's to gamble, but I'm not saying that's the
right way to do it. I think it's the easiest, but it's also doesn't have a high probability of
hitting it. And so you're most likely, you're just going to end up basically the same or worse off.
My counter is like, and said all the time you spend doing this stuff, I bet there's something
out there that you can spend time on. If you do it for a few years, you'll start earning more
money from that. And if you do it for a really long time, you can start earning even more money
from that. Right. And so as bad as my, you know, me not being into crypto, and I obviously made the
wrong choice on Bitcoin, right. With, I had no idea where the price was going to go. I believe
I've made far more money by not paying attention to it and focusing on the stuff that I enjoy.
And I like, and writing about finance and trying to help people with their finances and writing
books, like that's done far more for me in my life and my career than any investment return ever
would. If I had held that Bitcoin, I would had another, let's say if it's at one 20 today,
I sold a 52, I'd have another, you know, $60,000 like, okay, you know, for someone in level four,
60 grand is not a ton of money. I mean, it's, it's nice, but it's not going to change my life.
If you, if you hand me a check for 60 grand right now, I don't change a single thing about my
behavior. Right. And that's not because that's because that's what happens as you go higher up
the wealth ladder, the money matters less and less. And so you're going to hand me a check for
60 grand. I'll say, Oh, thank you. That's very nice of you, but I'm not going to go and change
anything about my life. I'm not going to change a single thing about my life. So think about what's
actually going to change your life and the types of decisions and behaviors on all those and
getting rich in one crypto coin that can get you there, but are you going to sell at the top? Are
you going to do it perfectly? I doubt it. Are you going to double down and then lose it? I don't
know. And these are the types of questions that, that I have with, with people that do this stuff.
Nick, that's exactly why we're doing these episodes, doing some base level wealth episodes,
because a lot of people listening in bankless, they came at wealth by route of crypto. And so
don't have some of these underlying principles that I think are going to be important for them
moving forward. So thank you so much for writing this book, for presenting this, this mental model.
It's been incredibly useful. So we appreciate it. Yeah. Thank you for having me on.
And really quick, when does the book come out and where can folks find it?
July 22nd. So depending on when this airs, it may already be out. So.
Amazing. I've got a copy of it myself. Bankless Nation, gotta let you know. Of course,
none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in,
but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone,
but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
