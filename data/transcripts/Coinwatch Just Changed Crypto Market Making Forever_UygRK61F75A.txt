Market makers are hedge funds in crypto.
You know, there is, of course,
the concept of a franchise business
and they have sales team,
but ultimately they're profit driven.
They're here to make money.
I'm not saying that they don't care about clients.
I'm not saying that they don't care
about their responsibility as a providing markets,
but they are not regulated like a market maker,
like a Citadel is in trade side, right?
Technically, when you look at the paperwork,
they are pure hedge fund.
Bankless Nation, I'm here with Brian and Matt
from CoinWatch.
Brian, Matt, welcome to the show.
Thanks for having us, David.
Thanks to you guys for having us.
CoinWatch is probably not a name
that the average listener is familiar with,
but by the end of the episode,
we're gonna illuminate exactly what you guys are doing
because what you guys are doing
are illuminating a part of the market
that is very important for informed investors
to be aware of.
This has been a topic, market making has been a topic
with a potentially, or a particularly large limelight
in the first half of 2025 downstream
from a bunch of just controversies, debacles, drama,
as it relates to toxic market making deals
with liquid tokens that have generated a bunch of hype.
And so this is definitely a part
of crypto's overall market structure
that needs to get repaired, needs to get fixed,
needs to be a little bit more orderly.
And something that you guys are announcing today
is definitely going to help with that.
Now, I don't wanna get to that part
of this conversation too fast, too soon.
I want to slow roll our way there
to really be able to land the importance
of what you guys are doing.
And then we'll get to the exact product release
that you guys are bringing to the table.
Before we go there, I want to just educate listeners
on exactly the part of the market that we are talking about.
So we'll just quickly do kind of like a one-on-one
on market making and how deals get inked
and who is at the table when deals get inked
and how deals end up looking like the way that they look
so that when we talk about what you guys are releasing today,
we can talk about how that's impacted.
Let's start there.
Market makers, what do they do?
Why do we need them?
How do they operate?
How do they make money?
And then why are they so ripe for toxic behavior?
All of these questions are very big,
but Matt, I'll throw it to you first
to try and tackle this pretty big subject all in one.
Great questions and important to lay out
the ground foundation for this conversation.
So market makers, I think there was a lot of,
I'd say caricature going around in crypto Twitter
about the bad market maker who's responsible
for price going down and all of the ills
of any token really price direction
is always the fault of the market maker,
that shadowy entity that operates in the shadows
and it's a hedge fund, it's an investment firm,
it's what exactly do they do.
So at the core of the definition of a market maker
is really the job of providing bids and offers
in an older book.
That's it, that's market making.
Literally putting a lot of bids,
ideally as close to the made as possible
and a lot of offers and with these orders
being made available in the book,
now if you or me or our friends wanna trade,
buy or sell this token, they will meet these orders
when they try to buy and sell and that is gonna give us
ideally a better buying price or selling price.
Without market makers, potentially these orders
would not be available in the book and as a result,
we would only be facing what we call natural buyers
and sellers and guess what?
Natural buyers and sellers are not there every day.
Sometimes they only trade on weekends,
sometimes they only trade when the token is interesting,
when the token is being talked about,
but really if you wanna be able to trade whenever
in Asian and European and American time zone,
you need to have market makers in the book
to provide that constant 24-7 liquidity.
That's at the heart of the job of the market maker.
So when I'm going on to an exchange
and I'm buying and selling a token,
typically the base case is my counterparties
probably a market maker somewhere
and usually that works out for both parties
because me as the buyer or seller,
I'm usually getting a better deal
and then the market maker is able to equilibrate,
is able to arbitrage across different venues
so that they can also gain a profit by matching an order
that's on one side like on Coinbase
with matching an order that is somewhere else,
Binance or Hyperliquid or on-chain somewhere.
So usually both parties are pretty happy
and that's kind of like the happy case, right?
That's the happy case and also the classic image says
that while the market maker is putting an offer
that's typically above mid-price
and a bid that's below mid-price.
So if they do this a lot
and they sell to you slightly above
and they buy back from Ryan or Brian
slightly below mid-price and they do that a lot,
well, they make money, right?
They sell high, buy low and they do that many,
many times per day and that makes money
and then the arbitrage of course that you just mentioned,
that makes money.
Everybody should be happy.
Market makers are making money.
Client is buying or selling at a better price
than otherwise and happy days everywhere.

And so why are market making,
why is market making so ripe for toxic behavior?
Because like downstream of the first half of this year,
I think the term, the idea of market making
has kind of become like a bad word.
It's like market making,
oh, you're doing something bad
is like people's connotation.
Really? What?
You can get into that, David,
because I don't really have that connotation,
but I just missed like three months in crypto.
So maybe it happened while I was out.
You actually skipped this phase of the crypto market
when you were gone from-
Yeah, when I left, market making was neutral.
There were like players like Jump Capital
who had like, you know, bad reputations,
but so what happened?
Maybe people don't know that story like me.
Maybe to be, to kind of be reductive about it,
the idea of market making has not completely,
but has been connotated with toxic behavior,
market manipulation, extraction, down only charts,
and pumping prices to have like insider cabal deals
between founders, market makers, and VCs.
And so while like there's the idea of market making,
which is neutral,
I think specifically market making in crypto
has been too closely associated with like toxic behavior.
But isn't this more of a symptom
of the high FTV, low float types of tokens,
you know, kind of like the VC type tokens?
Isn't it more that?
And market makers are just kind of fulfilling
the liquidity of maybe a bad deal to begin with,
or am I missing something?
I don't know, maybe Matt, Brian,
you can kind of chime in here
with your guys' perspectives as to like,
if how like on target we are here.
There's a lot to unpack here.
And first, let me go back to
why are market makers involved here in the first place?
And then Brian, please jump in to describe a bit more
the shadier side of market making.
So going back to the market maker, right?
The market maker, you might think, oh great,
you know, market maker gets to buy cheap and sell high,
so they make money, so everything's fine.
Well, actually it's not exactly working like that.
When you look at the stock that's in the S&P 500
that trades a ton,
you have basically 50-50 chance of buying and selling.
So the market maker will naturally equilibrium himself.
However, in crypto, that's not really the case.
As you know, when something's hot, everybody wants to buy.
When something's going down, everybody wants to sell.
And so that means that the market maker
is usually the one left holding the bag, right?
Imagine being the market maker for Solana
at launch six or seven years ago,
and you start making markets,
literally showing offers at 90 cents,
then a dollar, then a dollar 10,
all the way to $200 a year later,
you've been selling, selling, selling.
Well, you're gonna be losing a lot of money there, right?
And so to compensate for that potential loss,
the market making industry in crypto
has found this structure
that now makes probably 90 to 95%
of the large market making deals,
which is essentially the following.
The client, the token, the foundation,
will extend to the market maker a loan of token, right?
Here you go, market maker, GSR,
flow traders, winter mute, you name it, right?
You receive a loan of token.
And the loan says, at maturity,
either you return to me the tokens in full,
exactly the amount that I lent to you,
or you return to me a dollar amount.
That is essentially giving a call option
to the market maker.
And from that call option comes value,
mark to market, as we call it.
If you were to price that call option
in a Black Scholes model,
typically they're worth between half a million dollar
and many, many millions of dollars.
And through the option now,
the market maker has a lot of power for a simple reason.
If they wanna sell the loan that they received,
they can do so very safely.
Because if the price was to keep on rallying,
so they sell and the price keeps on going up and up and up,
it's okay because they have a strike.
They have the call option that protects them.
And this is where the misbehavior comes from.
The very large loan means that the market maker
on day one or day two or day seven
are one of the only counterparty in the market
that can sell in size,
because their drop recipients are, of course,
very heterogeneous.
Investors are not liquid.
Team is not liquid.
Foundation is usually even not liquid.
So only the market maker and a bunch of retail have tokens.
And the call means that they can sell in size
without any repercussion, without any risk to them.
And this has given rise to a number of behaviors
that are not directly related to providing liquidity
and more so to maximizing their profit.
And this is where, of course,
some bad things can increase in size
and take an absurd proportion.
And Brian, you can talk about this a little more,
but about six months ago,
we started to see a rise in the number of projects
that were interested in looking at parallel structures
to not so much provide liquidity,
but really help them manage the price of their token.
Yeah, I mean, to provide a little bit more color.
Ryan, I think your understanding is consistent
with the way market making used to work this time,
about a year ago.
But I would say a lot of projects
looking at a lot of the 2024 launches,
seeing sort of the down only price action
of a lot of these launches,
started looking for alternatives,
ways that they could sort of financially engineer price.
And you're right to spot the connection
between sort of low flow, high FDV,
and some of the more toxic behaviors
that I think David is mentioning,
because they are related.
You know, what projects basically started to do,
in some cases, not all projects,
is sort of a multi-step process
that would probably be illegal in TradFi.
You know, it would be considered market manipulation.
And so what they would do is,
first they would make the flow of their token really low.
There would be misrepresentations about the float,
of course, because, you know,
crypto Twitter would be very upset
if you advertise that your true float is actually 1%.
So projects would start by sort of
misrepresenting their float,
saying that, you know, my float is 20%,
when in reality, you know, it's closer to 1%.
Then projects would accumulate cash somehow.
There's different ways that you can do this.
You can sell locked tokens to liquid funds,
you can get a loan,
or you can partner with a shady market maker
who has a balance sheet.
Projects would then use the cash
to sort of pump the price of their token,
generating a chart that goes up and to the right,
with the hope that this entices retail to buy their token.
Then once the project's token
has reached a sufficient price,
the market maker or the project itself
might start dumping tokens, you know,
out of their foundation to generate cash.
Now, if the project is able to sell enough tokens at the top,
then when the price starts dumping,
which it inevitably will in, you know,
one of these structures, and we can talk about why,
well, they give them ammunition
to buy back the float of their token.
What the overall structure allows
is basically projects to paint a chart.
Now, during the Gensler era, this was super uncommon.
You know, no good lawyer would sign off
on these types of structures.
But I think during the Trump era,
because people, for whatever reason,
perceive that the SEC will be a lot more lax
in sort of pursuing enforcement cases against projects,
they're a lot more open
to some of these shadier structures.
Does that make sense?
Yeah, it totally makes sense.
I guess I have one follow-up,
which is like, how does this work in non-crypto markets?
Like the function of a market maker is much different,
it sounds like, they're not fulfilling this sort of role.
Like almost how should it work?
I'll jump in, because I was a market maker myself
in Shroud 5 for about 10 years.
The way it works is that the trading volume
is order of magnitude larger than what you would see
on Qcoin or Coinbase or BitGit
when you look at equity market making.
And so in that case, really,
the market maker makes money just by having inventory.
They don't need a call option.
They're not paid a call option.
They're usually paid by the exchange
and have very strong KPIs with the exchange,
NYSE, NASDAQ, to hit those liquidity metrics.
You need to be up in the order book 99.99% of the time.
Your bid offer spread needs to be 0.01% all the time.
You need to have at least $10,000 up this far away from it.
And the market maker is gonna make a lot of money
just trading around that flow,
because you're gonna get a lot of buy orders
and a lot of sell orders.
That's not the case in crypto.
Of course, people think about hype,
think about big tokens, BTC and Solana and Ethereum,
but very quickly you go into the long tail,
which actually doesn't trade that much.
When it trades just a few million dollars per day,
you're gonna be bleeding money market making.
And that's why market makers have typically required
an incentive, an extra payment
in the form of either a call option or retainer deals,
which are the two main, let's say types of deals
that we see in crypto market making today.
Is there regulatory reasons as well, Matt?
So in addition to making it up on volume,
let's say making a profitable business,
because equities are such higher volume,
is there any regulation that basically prohibits
market makers from getting into
this call option type territory?
That's a very good question.
Honestly, like for penny stocks, for example,
certainly you still need a market maker
and yet you don't trade like Tesla stock
or anything like that.
So is there an extra incentive that comes in?
Is there large retainer payments?
I don't know because I wasn't trading small cap equities,
but probably there is extra fees coming to the market maker
so that they can kind of make themselves whole.
So you talked about one of the reasons
why this dynamic exists is because tokens in crypto
tend to have crazy price action.
And when a market maker is market making for like
sole at 50 cents, for example,
and then sole goes up to $200
and they were selling sole all on the way up,
they're missing out on that potential gain.
Why is that bad?
Because they shouldn't, if they're delta neutral
and they're just selling sole on the way up,
sure, they're missing out on the price appreciation of sole
as it goes from 50 cents to $200,
but they're market makers, they're not hedge funds.
They should be missing out on the price appreciation
of tokens because they get their revenue
from arbitraging across exchanges.
So why is missing out on the price increase
actually all that bad if their business model
is more aligned with just volume arbitrage
across different venues?
That's a very good question.
I'm smiling because all these things we hear a lot
from market makers.
We're not a hedge fund and we're here at delta neutral
and we make money on arbitrage.
These things are not true.
Each of them.
Market makers are hedge funds in crypto.
There is of course a concept of a franchise business
and they have sales team,
but ultimately they're profit driven.
They're here to make money.
I'm not saying that they don't care about clients.
I'm not saying that they don't care
about their responsibility as a providing markets,
but they are not regulated like a market maker,
like a Citadel is in trade side.
Technically, when you look at the paperwork,
they are pure hedge fund.
Making money on arbitrage,
that just is not really available anymore.
Arbitrage is certainly available at launch
and a few days post launch
and we track a lot of launch action for our clients.
So we're full control looking at price differences.
Really you have the kimchi premium
that pretty much happens every single time a bit
and bit them is gonna go live with the token.
Apart from that, here and there sporadically,
a couple of projects maybe in Q4 had like three, four, five,
10% at most arbitrage between OKX and Bybit
because of some idiosyncratic reasons that we can get into,
but these things don't really happen.
And then the arbitrage is tiny.
So there's very, very small amount of money to be made
and the arbitrage band that you see a basis point
or two basis points is hard to capture
simply because everything runs in AWS.
This is not a co-location
and you can immediately capture the price difference.
No, there's a lot of risk and settlement risk
and exchange custodial risk.
So this is actually fair value.
You cannot capture that last basis point.
Market makers make money
if they are in the option of market making business
by either trading around the option,
meaning when the price goes above the strike,
they start to sell more, delta hedging more.
And when it goes back down below the strike of the option,
they buy back whatever they sold.
If you do that a lot,
you're gonna make money on that's called gamma trading.
And, or you make the right trading call
and you say, actually, this is Solana, this is gonna rip.
So I'm not gonna delta hedge anything.
I'm not gonna sell any of the tokens
that I have to hedge my option.
I'm gonna let it run.
And then you don't sell at a dollar,
you don't sell at two, you don't sell at 50,
you don't sell at 100.
You sell it only all the way at the top.
You made the most amount of money here,
but you can make money both ways.
And you can also make money on the way down
simply by selling everything, by overselling,
over hedging your delta.
So then you sell the entirety of your token notional.
And now you have no more tokens.
So you have a lot of dollars
with which you can still market make, bid side.
You don't show anything on the offer side anymore,
but bid side, you can still meet your KPIs.
The token goes back down because get what?
All of these tokens that have been sold,
they kind of wait on the token supply,
especially if you signed a very large deal,
a very large token notional to your market maker.
And then they wait for zero and buy back.
So I'm not saying that this is very common,
but certainly there is ways to make money on the way up,
on the way down, and on the way around the option strike.
And I was an option trader for 10 years,
so I've done these things at length and professionally.
So yeah, it's not all arbitrage.
Market makers would like to you to think
that they only make money by doing something very useful
for the community, which is aligning prices.
That's just not true.
So I think I have my answer to the question
that I was asking earlier,
which is why do market makers have a bad rap right now?
It is because these charts that are being painted
through this type of activity,
because they're not just market making,
they're actually like playing with options essentially.
And they're painting these charts that go up quite a lot
in a very short amount of time.
Retail buys kind of the top,
or starts sticking along the top of these charts,
and then price comes crashing down,
a lot of retail is left with bag holders,
and over and over we go again and again and again.
Feels like a short-termism.
Is this a summary of why retail investors in crypto
are just so jaded and pissed off
at market making type activity?
Yeah, I think so.
One thing I wanna disambiguate between though
is sort of the toxic market manipulation,
and then the normal job of liquidity provisioning,
which does in crypto, at least often require
projects to extend market makers to call option.
Because these firms, Wintermute, GSR, Flow Traders,
they're not in the business of manipulating markets.
Matt, can you maybe explain the positive case
for why market makers need a call option
just to do their job?
Yeah, I think the Solana example is just the right one,
and it happens more often than not.
Thankfully, you are the contracted market maker
for Solana at launch back in 2019,
and you start the launch, it launches on Binance at 90 cents
a year and a half later, it's at $200.
You need a call option to protect you
because everybody's gonna be buying from you, everybody.
Unlike Tesla stock where it's buying and selling,
no, everybody's gonna be buying.
So you're gonna be selling and selling and selling.
So imagine being Solana, here you go Amber,
here is two million Solana tokens for you.
In one year's time, you gotta give them to me.
Okay, sure.
Oh, but I sold them today.
Oh, and I sold the token tomorrow and the day after that.
So, and all the way up to $200.
I showed bid prices, but nobody traded on my bid.
Everybody took me on my offers.
So the call option protects you
in case of this giant runner up.
And exactly as Brian says,
it's important to really differentiate
between the market makers who specialize in painting charts
and what they call active market making.
You always have to take this qualifier
with a pinch of salt because there is no such thing
as active and passive market making in trade fight.
It's a thing made up in crypto to really say,
well, these people are gonna try and manage the price.
She's not the point of market making.
And then the very serious established market makers,
still profit-driven,
but they're here to provide liquidity.
The Wintermute, the Amber, the Oros, the Keyrock,
et cetera, et cetera, names I'm sure
that you're very familiar with,
which are never gonna do that simply because,
I mean, not only it's extremely unethical,
but also if they get found and dragged into a lawsuit,
that's it for their business,
because this is extremely bad for any investor,
any potential future plans to raise money, to even IPO.
I mean, this would be a huge black mark for the shop.
So they wanna make money,
but while staying on the right side of the law
or the ethics, that are pretty clear.
So what I'm hearing is that this call option
part of market making can be good.
It can be a very strong component
of creating a necessary deal
between a market maker and a token.
And it's also ripe for,
it creates the surface area for toxic behavior.
And so this same deal could be inked
between a token and a market maker.
And if the market maker is good,
then there's positive outcomes
where spot market token buyers are also happy.
Or with a different market maker, it could be toxic,
where the outcome is that spot market token buyers
are actually very unhappy
because of the nature of the market maker.
So there's some trust involved
with the market maker in question
to actually be a good actor.
And I guess you don't really know ahead of time
when these deals are inked.
And so there's a gray line here
between market makers are supposed to be unopinionated.
They're supposed to just dance around the spot.
They're not supposed to have opinions
about whether the market's going to go up or down.
But because of crypto, because it is what it is,
there needs to be this extra thing,
which is the call option,
that brings on aligned market makers
to do their job inside of crypto-specific context.
But then that also does open up the door
for the barbarians at the gate to get through
and then also become toxic market makers.
And we don't really know until after the fact.
And also it just so happens that toxic market makers
have quite a lot of optionality
to extract quite a lot of money.
And there's this one more component
that market makers might be able to coordinate
with a founder or also perhaps with VCs.
And everyone can be in on it
and really just everyone is winning
and retail is just the exclusive loser here.
I think this is really the narrative that happened
in the first half of this year.
I don't know how much insight or clarity you have
as to how rampant that kind of behavior was
or even maybe that's actually just a boogeyman story
that retail loves to tell.
Maybe you could provide some clarity, Matt.
Like is the whole like cabal between market makers,
VCs and founders sitting down at a table
to negotiate the right deal
so that they can get paid from like retail buying spot.
Is that a real thing?
Is that a real story?
Or is that mostly a boogeyman?
Maybe you could tell us some examples
of what's real and what's fake.
Sure, so first of all,
we have some selection bias at CoinWatch
simply because what we do is really
about bringing transparency,
about breaking that dynamic
that is long established in crypto,
which is clients lend a giant amount of tokens
to market makers and market makers for a year
have complete freedom
as to how they're gonna use these tokens.
Our whole mission is to stop that,
to bring accountability and transparency
throughout that relationship
so that market makers are actually held accountable
with what they do with the tokens.
That's a little aside.
So because that's our job,
protocols are gonna try and do these deals,
you know, these mercury deals
to do things that are unethical
and to let's say accelerate their price chart.
They don't want a third party professional coming in
and bringing transparency on the contrary.
They want as much opacity as possible.
They don't want anybody to know about it
except the people around the table.
So we've never been invited at one of these tables
and thankfully, because quite frankly,
I don't know what I would have to do with this information,
but certainly what we've seen in Q1 and Q2
as Brian said earlier,
was a broad repricing of the regulatory risk
that you take on by exploring,
let's say more creative structures,
to put it mildly.
Ultimately, these structures,
is really about, as Brian said,
getting cash today, whatever tomorrow,
or let's just sell a bunch of tokens in six months.
Nobody cares because in six months,
that's many years from now in crypto time, right?
So let's just get the cash now
and with the cash we buy tokens and token price goes up
because circulating supply is small
so nobody can sell and it's great.
Are VCs happy about it?
Well, I mean, sure they can, you know,
mark to market their position higher,
but VCs by and large don't really have any liquid tokens
to sell into that rally.
What they can do is sell perps,
but from our experience,
and of course we work closely with big name VCs,
but these guys are not really trading perps.
You know, maybe they have one guy
doing the liquid fund on the side,
and this person, they buy a lock token,
it's probably because they think it's a good discount,
it's interesting.
But by and large, VCs are not gonna try and do these things
because these structures are by design very short-term.
And the more they get done,
the more short-term they become.
You know, before you had six months before the unlock,
now you have three weeks
before the perp market catches on and the price crashes.
So the VCs are like, wait a minute,
I'm investing in one year, right?
I don't care about the price now,
I care about the price in one year,
so let's not do that.
Certainly market makers,
let's call them active market makers
because they love to give them some of these titles,
so let's leave them with that.
Active market makers go around all conferences
and go and talk to every founder
and says, look, we did active market making
on this token price,
it's the only token that's up in this category, right?
Don't you want your token price to go up?
Work with us.
And so founders really, for them,
you can kind of see,
because they don't come from finance,
they're not market experts,
but a lot of them see price as a problem
that you can engineer yourself out of,
just like a bug on your landing page.
And so they're like, oh, yeah,
I'd rather have a higher price.
I can actually get my price go higher.
Let's do it.
And it's really toxic, right?
And generally in finance, you have two rules.
The first one is the Wall Street Journal rule.
If whatever you do,
you're not comfortable having it on the front page
of the Wall Street Journal, don't do it.
And the market is always right.
So you can do,
you can get the price in a certain direction
for a certain amount of time.
At the end of the day,
the market will go where it wants to go, full stop.
And usually, of course, these things are not zero sum, right?
A lot of people lose a lot of money there.
So yeah, that's kind of where we are today.
And in my opinion, this whole change of,
call it vibe, comes from the fact that people are like,
oh, we're never gonna get sued,
so let's just try new things.
Okay, so in this example,
VCs can actually get kind of like
the short end of the stick as well,
because they're locked up.
So it actually can just be a coordinated deal between,
this is in the unhappy case,
this is in the nefarious case,
it's not all cases,
but in the nefarious case,
it can be a coordinated deal between founding team members,
people with very large token supplies
on the team side of things, and the market maker.
And these two parties can come together,
create a deal where like,
they all kind of understand, wink, wink,
that this token is not gonna be valuable
in 12 plus months.
But in the short term,
they can just do negotiated extraction
where the team is still vested,
but the market maker is this imbued entity
that gets this supply of tokens according to the foundation.
They can market make with those tokens,
extract many dollars by controlling the price,
because when you have so much control of the total float,
then you get to basically pick what the price is,
you get to pick the price that spot market buyers buy in at,
and that money turns into reserves
that the foundation has, that the market has,
that these two entities can split
and then go their happy ways with mansions and Lambos,
and then VCs actually don't get anything,
and retail investors also don't get anything.
Certainly.
And so this is the unhappy case.
Ryan, this is what we were talking about,
the negative connotation that market makers
have been given in the first half of this year.
And to be fair, I wanna believe that founders have no,
they're not thinking, oh, in one year's time,
it's worth zero, so I'm gonna sell everything.
I wanna believe that Rushy was actually doing this
because he thought genuinely it was good for his price.
I don't know, but I really hope so.
I kinda wanna give the benefit of the doubt to the guy.
But certainly the end result is extremely bad,
because once the shape, once the chart looks like
one of these now pretty famous lock token deal charts,
there are quite a few around in Q1 and Q2, that's it.
Credibility is gone, your ability to close any new
of these deals is gone.
Fundraise, let's not even talk about it.
Your community is gonna be like,
wait a minute, we were up 150%,
now we're down 10 on the year.
Nothing has changed, what exactly happened?
So it is quite regrettable.
The good news is that I think the tide is shifting.
The pendulum is swinging back and people now realize that,
okay, this is actually extremely short term
and I'm gonna completely destroy the future of the project
because yeah, I'm gonna make a few people happy
for a few weeks, but that's just what I'm getting
while burning millions of dollars in cash.

So you guys have a solution that you guys are bringing
to this table, into the market,
which I almost want to get to.
The last conversation I wanna get to
before we introduce this product
is a little bit about who you guys are.
Brian and Matt and CoinWatch,
can you illuminate for us
where your perch is in the market?
Who are you guys?
What do you do?
Why do you have the knowledge that you have?
What's your vantage point?
Where would you describe you guys?
All right, so let's rewind a little bit.
We're back in 2018.
So I was 10 years a market maker in traditional finance
and trading options, so the oil book at Barclays.
And pretty tired of that.
And I was looking for something else to do.
It was 2018.
And guess what?
Bitcoin was up a lot.
And I start to look at it and like,
well, this is brilliant.
I wanted to stop trading
and to do something else with my life.
And I'm like, okay, I made a bit of money
so I can take my time and explore
and maybe do like everybody else, do an MBA
or just explore this thing that's called crypto.
There was this company named CoinList in New York also
who was hiring.
And I was like, hey guys, I'm this trader guy
and I'm interested in Bitcoin.
And how about we just let me interview.
And so CoinList was super nice.
And they hired me as a PM.
I had no idea what a product was.
All my life I'd been on the trading floor,
buying and selling.
The only thing I knew how to do.
And so Brian, one of the co-founders of CoinList,
quickly we started to get along.
We were about 20 in this office.
And one thing that CoinList was doing really well
back then was token sales.
And still today, token sales.
So Filecoin and Solana and Flow and SellO
and all these projects will do token sales on CoinList.
And so I was kind of the trader guy sitting in the corner
looking for something to do.
And what was my job exactly?
And so a few of these token sales projects came to me
and said, hey, look, we are about to launch an exchange.
We're being told we need a market making deal.
Back then it was basically Jump and GSR.
That was it.
And so we have a term sheet for a market making deal.
Do you mind looking at it?
And so I'm like, okay, sure.
And so that's what got me started.
So I negotiated the first Solana market making deal
and then Flow and then Filecoin and SellO, et cetera.
The idea back then, the angle was,
hey, I'm gonna negotiate your market making deal
and help you get a better option
because oh my God, what I was seeing in those term sheets
was just a fall of my chair.
But in exchange for that,
you are gonna ask your market makers
to also provide liquidity to CoinList exchange,
not just to Binance and Kraken and Coinbase.
So that was, of course, very,
that was a lot of value for CoinList
because liquidity is expensive
and they were not paying for it.
And so then I left CoinList and Brian also left CoinList
and we kind of went our own ways.
I went to Coinbase and Dapper.
Brian worked on a number of on-chain protocols
as an engineer.
And one day I get hit up by Andreessen
and Andreessen tells me,
hey, we heard about what you were doing at CoinList,
helping projects not get completely fused
by the market makers.
Would you mind helping some of our protocols
who have this problem very much now?
That's three years later,
three years after I quit CoinList.
I'm like, well, yeah, sure, I can do it on the weekend
because I have a full-time job now.
And so I start to do it on the weekends
and WorldCoin was declined that they were talking about.
And so I start to advise WorldCoin
and then more and more and more projects came.
I'm like, okay, I should really stop
doing whatever I'm doing at Dapper Labs back then.
And of course, the NFT wave had by then crested
and I hit up Brian.
I'm like, Brian, let's build this.
I can do the advisory,
but I need to be able to track market makers
to see what they're doing
because I can negotiate the best deal in the world,
have a really good option with really great liquidity.
If we don't make sure that market makers
deliver what they promised,
this time is wasted, right?
What is the point?
And so that was the split of responsibility.
I was advising and Brian was building the product.
And so that's the genesis story of CoinWatch.
That's three years ago now.
Now we're 10 people, about four engineers.
The rest is your product and operations
and myself still doing very much the account management.
And the place of CoinWatch in the market today
is really we help some of the biggest project
negotiate better market making deals
with their market makers.
Deal that makes sense,
deal that are appropriately sized
for the liquidity that they get
and deals that our clients can get out of
if something goes wrong.
You'd be pretty shocked to read term sheets
where essentially the market maker is like,
yeah, yeah, yeah, so if we don't do things right,
well, you're just gonna have to wait a year
to get back your loan.
And we still keep the option.
It's like, what kind of remedy is that?
It's really quite crazy.
I still sometimes have a heart attack
when I read some term sheets that clients sign
before we get involved.
So that's the story and the purpose that we felt.
Negotiating and tracking.
We've done this for some of the largest projects out there
from Morpho to Babylon and Eigenlayer
and I'm just being careful
because I know some of them are very confidential.
We, yeah, we worked with-
Optimism, Aptos, yeah.
If I may correct the timeline a little bit, Matt,
the first projects we worked with were like Optimism
and Aptos and at that point what happened is
all the other top PCs who I knew through my network
as a founder basically heard
that we could provide this service.
And so we started advising all of their portfolio companies.
Yeah, that's kind of the genesis of Fortwatch.
I know the WorldCoin sale was really controversial.
I mean, ironically, they didn't,
not the WorldCoin sale rather,
the WorldCoin token launch.
Ironically, they didn't really follow
a standard market maker structure,
didn't really follow our structure.
But yeah, Matt was advising them
in the background here and there.
And yeah, and then tracking of course was always
the big piece and tracking was always extremely hard
for a simple reason.
Ryan, David, go on Binance right now
and look at the price of Bitcoin.
It's a beautiful thing.
But tell me who's doing what in this order book.
You don't know.
Wintermute, GSR, Amber, KeyRog, you have no idea.
Same for us.
We had the same access.
And so because of that, we crafted the deal,
but the deal was essentially, well, market maker,
as long as liquidity is good on Bybit,
we're gonna assume it's you and congratulations.
But hey, we had no idea.
It could be Bybit being very liquid
because Bybit has a lot of users
or it could be that market maker was working hard
and vice versa.
If liquidity was bad, well, was it the fault of GSR
or flow traders or others?
Whose fault was it?
And so we were faced with that wall
that prevented us from connecting the deal that was made
to the work provided by the market maker.
And this is kind of, of course, a segue to the product
that we are now launching that solves this issue.
That's a long-standing issue and that we're so happy
that we finally managed to bring to market.
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll pause here for dramatic effect.
Talk to us about the products that you guys are releasing.
I'll prime the listener with the phrase,
sunlight is the best disinfectant.
I think the thing that you guys are really doing
is you're bringing sunlight into a part of the market
that the market has never had before.
Investors who want to be informed
just haven't had the information available to them,
the tools available to them to really see what's going on
and peer behind the curtain.
So what is the sunlight?
What's the mechanism that you guys are bringing to the table
that is becoming a tool in the tool belt
for informed investors to be more informed?
I'll let the architect of the product take over
because it's all his build.
The high-level pitch for the product is basically
that CoinWatch Track, which is what those things call them,
allows projects to see what their market makers are doing
in real time, 100% verified using market maker API keys.
So this enables projects to basically
hold their market makers accountable
and ensure they get what they paid for.
How are they getting transparency before?
Was it completely trust-based as you hand over the tokens
and then you kind of vibe the volume on Binance
or Bybit exactly what Matt was just saying
and hope that it kind of checks out
and if it checks out close enough, then you're happy.
And if it doesn't check out not nearly close enough,
then you, I don't know what you would do.
But how would they verify that the market makers
is actually following through on their obligations
prior to this product?
Yeah, there wasn't a really good way.
Often the obligations would be defined
in terms of the aggregate sort of depth
in the order book, for example.
So you can see there's a million dollars
in the order book on Binance,
but there was really no good way to know
how much of that is the market maker, right?
Is 900K of that the market maker
in which case they're doing an incredible job
or maybe it's only 25K and the market maker
actually sold all their tokens at launch
and now they're super short, right?
You just don't know.
You don't know, you don't know.
And these are the things going through founder's head
and especially when price starts going down,
they get really paranoid, et cetera, et cetera.
There was kind of a bit of a historical solution to this,
but it was a pretty bad solution,
which was market makers would self-report
their trading data, their trade,
high level statistics on their trading information.
You know, this would be things like daily depth,
daily average spread and daily average volume.
But this sucks, right?
The information is totally unverified.
So it's almost like having a student grade their own exam.
It's only reported once a day.
It's not real time.
So it's not very useful.
You know, if you're a founder,
you wanna be able to see,
oh, my token price is going down.
What is my market maker doing right this second?
And often these reports would come in a non-standard format
making it really difficult
to compare your different market makers.
So, you know, that's some of the problem
we're trying to solve with this new technology.
Brian, is this just for founders
or is this also for like retail investors as well?
Because that transparency as an investor
in one of these tokens
like would also be incredibly valuable to me.
Yeah, yeah.
It's something we're exploring, right?
So the information that we're starting to expose
to projects and founders is very sensitive, right?
So at least to start,
we need to slow roll this, right?
I don't know how market makers would feel
about revealing this type of information to VCs
or to the general public,
but it seems like the kind of thing
that is potentially worth doing in the long run.
Does that make sense?
We're basically asking market makers
to change quite a lot about the transparency
that they offer to projects.
And so we don't wanna freak them out
by asking them right off the bat,
oh, you should expose this to a project's VCs
or oh, you should expose this to the general public.
We'll see how that goes.
I don't wanna over promise,
but I mean, certainly it's technically possible.
Let's talk about, illuminate for us a little bit more
about what this project actually is.
CoinWatch Track is the name.
What does it do?
How does it work?
Where to begin?
So like I said, it allows projects to see
exactly what their market makers are doing
in real time using market maker API keys.
Getting market maker API keys has always kind of been
the holy grail of market maker tracking.
Because if you have market maker API keys,
you can see exactly what market makers are doing
in real time across all the exchanges, et cetera, et cetera.
But there's always been a problem,
which is that market makers don't wanna give
their API keys out to any third party.
Because it's kind of like showing your cards, right?
It's like if you're at the poker table
and it's like, okay, please show me your cards.
It doesn't exactly work.
Yeah, if a malicious third party
got a hold of the market maker's API keys,
they'd be able to pull down the market maker's trades,
the market maker's open orders,
and use that information to trade against the market maker
and cause them to lose a lot of money.
So we've kind of been in this dilemma
for a long time in crypto,
where basically the best way to verify market maker activity
is to get their API keys,
but market makers have really good reasons
for not wanting to give out their API keys.
Does that make sense?
Totally, but then it begs the question,
why are they giving you their API keys?
What did you guys do that changes the game here?
Right, right.
And the truth is they're not actually
giving us their API keys.
What they're going to do is they give their API keys
to a trusted execution environment.
And so the way this works is basically market makers
put their API key into a trusted execution environment.
The trusted execution environment, or T,
is able to query exchanges,
pull down the information necessary
for computing statistics
that will ultimately go to the project.
So these statistics are things like market maker depth,
market maker spread, and market maker trading volume.
In order to compute these statistics,
the T needs to be able to pull down
the market maker's trades, the market maker's open orders,
all of this very sensitive information.
But this information never leaves
the trusted execution environment.
The only thing that's returned to projects
is the depth, the spread, the volume,
and a few other statistics.
So what ends up happening is projects are able
to get the information that they need
to verify whether market makers are doing their job
while preserving market maker's privacy and security.
Does that make sense?
Totally, yeah.
So TEEs are kind of like a ZK cryptography shortcut.
They aren't exactly ZK cryptography,
but they give a lot of the same properties
that ZK cryptography do.
And so just like you said, Brian,
it can show the output of something
without actually showing the work of how it got there.
And because it's inside of a TEE,
you can verify that the specific code
was ran in the correct way.
And so there's a little bit of a black box,
but you are okay with the contents of the black box
because you can verify the code that's running.
And then you can consume the outputs of said black box,
which is like Brian said, the information that you need,
which still allows the market maker
to kind of like keep their cards hidden.
But why would a market maker actually sign on
to do this in the first place?
What's the carrot for them?
Why?
Because it sounds like extra work
so far without too much incentive.
So what's the incentive?
That's a really great question.
And it comes from three things.
And you need those three things together
to be able to ship TEE.
The first thing is you need the technical know-how
to actually build it, code it.
And here, props to Brian and our excellent engineering team
who kind of built it in three weeks.
Crazy, but true.
The second one is clients.
Because if we go out of the blue to GSR
and to Amber and Oros and others and say,
hey, API keys, TE, they're gonna be like, dude, what?
Again, like you're already pressuring our margins,
negotiating all these deals.
Come on, no.
So you need a critical mass of clients
to go to the market maker and say, we want this,
this is real.
And if you don't do this, then bad things will happen.
We'll terminate the deal.
We'll just put our relationship to somewhere
where it will be more transparent.
And so this speaks to the work we've been doing
for the last three years,
working with the top projects out there who trust us,
who use us to track their market makers
and who kind of rely on CoinWatch to see the truth.
And when we provided this temporary idea to them and,
hey, guys, would you be okay to help us push this idea?
They were all like, yeah, sure, count us in.
We want this to happen, so let's try and get it done.
That's number two.
And number three, we also need great relationship
with the market makers.
Because market makers, yes,
they will probably all tell you
that CoinWatch is an annoyance.
CoinWatch has cost them a lot of money in the past
because we have broad deals to a much fairer value
and we track them and we keep them accountable.
So we're not necessarily-
You guys are the cops.
You guys are market cops.
We are, very much.
And so they don't love us,
but also they know that we're fair.
Myself being a market maker for so long,
I understand the P&L pressure and the balance
that you need to strike as a market maker.
And so in terms of the product specs,
we could not design the product just by kind of,
no, we need to know exactly what kind of depth is sensitive.
10 bips might be too sensitive.
50 bips sounds okay, right?
And really, feature by feature,
looking at the pros and cons and the trade-offs
of having the data and potentially angering market makers
and having less market makers onboarding
and not getting the data and having more people,
et cetera, et cetera.
So really coming up with the spec that makes sense
to meet the target which you just described, David,
which is getting the data that we need.
But the set that we don't need,
we're not gonna look at it and it's okay.
And that's gonna allow us to ship it.
So about two months ago, T went live for Babylon,
who pushed extremely hard to get it
for their token launch.
Five market makers were onboarded.
This is public, Babylon has five market makers signed
and it was published by Binance on the day of launch.
Today, two months later,
we have 13 market makers onboarded
and more in the wait list.
And that's what's amazing, David.
You were asking, why would market makers do this?
Well, now market makers see this as a way
to actually get deal flow
because they know that through CoinWatch,
a lot of deals are gonna come, number one.
And number two, if they can tell prospect clients of theirs,
we are onboarded to this platform.
So you should trust us when we say that we mean it,
when we say we do the right thing, we're transparent,
we're the good guys, we are on this platform.
It's not just in a PowerPoint, it's not just pretending.
We are so confident about the way we do things
and the way we trade and our value
as an ethical partner of projects
that we onboarded to this platform.
And so we're super happy to see that, yes,
some market makers are waiting for a spot, right,
for us to just crank enough engineering,
you know, man hours to onboard more market makers.
And now it's really becoming a badge of honor
for market makers and hopefully these market makers
will not only get more deal flow as a result.
And what other market makers love
is that now they can be compared to the big guys.
The work matters.
How much equity do you stream?
How much trading volume do you generate?
Right, it's not about the marketing,
it's not about how many hackathons you sponsored
or the event or the dinners that you paid
at the last conference.
It's about the work that you provide.
And our technology displays that trustlessly,
establishes a standard for the entire industry.
And we're very excited to see that many, many, many
market makers wanna be a part of this story.
You know, there's been a recent push for efforts like this
in the crypto markets recently,
just because I think a lot of liquid investors
are just kind of fed up with the state of affairs
as it is in the liquid markets.
I know Felipe Montenegre from Thea Capital
and also Blockworks have really been pushing
their token transparency report,
which is called like another tool
in the informed investors tool belt
to be able to be an uninformed investor.
One of the criteria in the token transparency report
that if you are a token and you want to be reported on
by the Blockworks token transparency report,
one of them is you have to actually
report your market making deals.
And then you'll get a grade as to how transparent
your market making deal is.
It'll be very nice as an informed investor
to be able to go to the Blockworks token transparency report
and look at that market making deal
and then go to the CoinWatch track product
and see if the token is one of the tokens
that is being traded on by the market makers
on the CoinWatch track product.
And so if I'm a liquid hedge fund,
which crypto is missing a lot of liquid investors,
by the way, because there's just been
this toxic equilibrium that we haven't really been able
to inform liquid funds about exactly the deals
that are going on behind the scenes.
If I'm a liquid fund, all of a sudden,
I'm seeing all the tools that are at my disposal,
CoinWatch track being one of the big ones.
And I just feel much more confident
in deploying liquid funds into places that I can see,
in places that I have sunlight shining on
that make me an informed investor.
And so perhaps we can zoom forward
into one, two, three years after this product really matures
and it becomes more closer to industry standard,
the tokens and the market makers
that are on CoinWatch track simply have more volume.
They have this, like you said, Matt,
a badge of honor of trust and credibility
because hopefully the product is working as intended.
It's aligning incentives between retail investors in spot,
founders and market makers.
And we are in a self-regulated, healthier equilibrium
because we've been able to use pretty cool technology,
TEEs, to shine lights on parts of the market
that we haven't shown light on before.
And so the ultimate bulk case for crypto is
we can fix this bad equilibrium that we've put ourselves in
because we were just kind of so offshore
and so unregulated as an industry
that we can't really provide investor confidence
to more capital to come into the industry.
So the bulk case for this product is
we actually open up the TAM for liquid funds to come in
and deploy more capital and have a tide
that raises all ships.
That's kind of my bulk case here.
I love to hear it.
Obviously you are preaching to the choir.
I think at the very least,
you know, kind of focusing the nose very close
to the road at Cone Watch as you can imagine.
But one thing that I absolutely love to see with this product
and I've been advising deals for many years, right?
Probably north of a hundred deals by now
from the first Solana one to the latest,
you know, whether that's Babylon or yeah.
Anyway, just a lot of launches.
Having this transparency,
you do not realize how much the pressure cooker
that is a launch just goes down, right?
Because now there is stress of,
oh, I'm sure my market makers sold it.
Actually, no, look, the tokens are in the order book.
I can show you real time
how many offers are in the book right now.
Why your market makers is 75% of buy bit today at your launch.
You can thank them.
Without them buy bit would be 75% smaller.
That's insane.
Your market makers actually working really hard here.
Hey, look at the trading volume they did today.
That's not them reporting.
Oh yeah, we did a really good job.
I'm gonna shake my own hand.
No, no, no, no, no.
We have the exact data down to the trading pair
to every exchange of what each market maker did.
So go and say thank you
because they actually did a terrific job.
But you know what, there is so much mistrust
and so much kind of bad blood
in these protocol market maker relationship
that by definition,
whatever comes from the market makers
has to be looked at with a very suspicious eye.
This is no longer the case.
Thanks to this product, it makes our life easier,
but also just in general,
the industry market maker protocol,
just the trust can be rebuilt
because there is data that you can trust to rely on
and base business decision
and yeah, your relationship on really.
I know retail investors, crypto Twitter,
they really tend to, when they hear one bad story, right?
Like the movement story
was really the bogeyman of the cycle.
And maybe it was as bad as people interpreted it to be.
And then like what the typical
like crypto Twitter retail reaction is,
is to extrapolate that so far
to like blanket over the whole rest of the market
and include otherwise good products in with the bad
because they just don't know.
They just don't have the information to say
that that's actually not the case.
And so one of the happy outcomes that I'm hoping for here
is we can actually differentiate
between the projects, the bogeymans
and actually the true noble products
that have done everything correctly,
everything by the books,
but they don't have the tools to differentiate
for themselves from the truly like insipidists
like cabal negotiating tables
that come at the cost of retail investors.
100%.
I think just one thing I wanna mention
is that we wanna make this technology available
to any crypto project, right?
Not just crypto projects who use CoinWatch
to negotiate their market-making deal.
So if you negotiate it on your own, totally fine.
If you use another advisor, totally fine
as long as the advisor agrees not to like knock off
our product or something like that.
We think that every crypto project should have the ability
to see what their market makers are doing.
It's just so important for the industry broadly.
And so we want everyone to use this.
We want it to be a market standard.
What can people go do right now?
You guys mentioned that you already have
something like 13 market makers who have signed up.
Are there token projects that have signed up?
And then if there are interested market makers
or interested founders or projects
that want to get in touch with you guys
to get on board here, what should they go do?
CoinWatch.co, our landing page,
there is a link there to submit a form to onboard
to get a demo, et cetera.
Twitter account is at coinwatch.co, D-O-T-C-O.
And market makers should not hesitate to use the same
channels to reach out to us if we have not spoken
with you yet and onboarded you yet.
We'll do our best for a small team again,
but yeah, we'll do our very best to onboard
as many market makers as possible.
Matt, Brian, I think what you guys are doing there
is very noble and I hope the best for you
because I think what's best for you
is also best for my bags as an owner of tokens
in this market, so I appreciate what you guys are doing.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks, David.
For giving us the chance to describe
what we've been working on and tell our story.
Bankless Ancient, you guys know the deal,
crypto is risky, hopefully a little bit less risky
every single day as products like this come into the market,
but nonetheless, you can lose what you put in.
We're on the frontier, it's not for everyone,
but we are glad you are with us on the Bankless Journey.
Thanks a lot.
