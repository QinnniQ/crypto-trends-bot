Why don't you buy some Bitcoin or ETH, buy some ETH?
I think maybe that's the thing to do.
There's something bizarre today happening with cryptocurrency.
You see, price short-term continues to consolidate.
Yet long-term, due to this recent pro-crypto regulation,
we're getting a very clear signal from major players.
A $185 billion key bank, a top 30 bank,
to launch Bitcoin trading in custody to its 3.5 million customers.
This is massive.
Now that we have some regulation here around stablecoin and crypto,
how are you feeling about getting in and using it as potentially a platform,
an option for your clients?
I mean, it's early, but I think it has a lot of promise,
and particularly around stablecoin.
And obviously, the Genius Act was just last week.
But when you think about stablecoin, there's really a few things.
There's the institutional piece, which will be the equivalent like prime brokerage.
That will be dominated by a single handful of international banks,
that huge volume, relatively narrow margins.
That's not really an opportunity or a challenge for us.
The next is as a store of value.
And clearly, to the extent, Sarah, that our clients want it
and they want to hold it in their wallets, we will accommodate that.
And so we'll be sure to do that.
So notice the one thing that fundamentally changed.
A few weeks ago, the stablecoin bill got signed into law.
This makes tokenizing dollars, digital dollars on blockchains like Ethereum,
like Solana, like XRP, make stablecoins regulated.
But what that allows for these institutions to have is custody.
KeyBank is now launching crypto trading in custody to its 3.5 million customers.
Clearly, to the extent, Sarah, that our clients want it
and they want to hold it in their wallets,
we will accommodate that.
And so we'll be sure to do that.
Meaning this stablecoin bill, in a sense, was a Trojan horse.
And even though we shot up to new all-time high with Bitcoin,
we're consolidating this week.
Looking back at history, that's very normal.
New all-time high, weeks of consolidation.
New all-time high, weeks of consolidation.
Obviously, macro events always come into play.
But this train has left the station.
Then there's the sort of discussion around,
is it going to cannibalize deposits at banks?
I actually think that's a fair...
I think it's a threat, but I don't think it's an immediate threat.
And I think the industry will respond.
I mean, whether it's with tokenized deposits,
which I think you'll see banks like Key do,
and you may well see...
I don't envision Key issuing a coin, per se,
but I could see us as part of a consortium of banks that issues a coin.
And now breaking news.
The seventh largest U.S. bank, PNC,
just announced they will be offering Bitcoin services
to their millions of clients.
Here's CEO of PNC on CNBC explaining.
Think of the business we're in.
We help people save, spend, invest, borrow, move money.
And crypto, stablecoin, in theory, is going to be a payment rail,
and our clients are going to want to use it,
and our job is to empower our clients to move money.
How they do it, and then, you know, whether it's pure retail,
whether it's wealth, whether it's our corporate clients
on international payments remains to be seen,
but it's our job to empower them.
We don't want to lose that stream of their payment flow.
So, you know, we put that in our toolkit
and let our clients use it if they want.
And when he says the bank of PNC will allow sending and receiving,
he essentially means they're creating a wallet,
a crypto wallet for every PNC customer.
We're not making a decision.
We're not going to produce a stablecoin, per se,
certainly not in our own name, but we'll be a wallet,
a provider for any coin that any of our clients want to use.
And this will onboard millions.
By the way, this is the same bank
that increased their Bitcoin ETF exposure last year by more than 500%,
meaning they bought Bitcoin around here,
and now they're finally allowing you to buy Bitcoin
when they get this implemented, their customers to buy Bitcoin around here.
And let's talk altcoins with the most potential making news today,
because I'm not saying we can't dip another 10, 15, maybe even 20%.
That's normal in Bitcoin consolidation.
In fact, it's healthy.
Consolidation is when weak hands sell to strong hands,
the inpatient sells to the patient,
and the long-term investors for assets with product-market fit,
where we see the fundamentals only getting better.
Those are the investors that make money.
And even CNBC stalwart Jim Cramer has capitulated.
He says, and I quote, and by the way, this is probably why Bitcoin dumped today.
We know the inverse Cramer law.
We all know the inverse Cramer investing law.
But he says, buy some Bitcoin.
Buy some ETH.
I buy it a lot because I'm very worried about the US deficit.
I think it's a nice hedge.
Look, the customers want it.
Now, what I had, it's very funny,
because everyone says the customers want it,
but when I had Michael Mibach on, who's the CEO of MasterCard,
he didn't think there was any real demand for it.
I mean, people want to trade.
I think people want to own some as a hedge against the $37, $8 trillion.
They want to own a debt.
They want to own it for their kids.
And you know who else feels that way?
Me.
I don't want that debt.
My kids. I'm worried about my kids.
I'm worried about your kids here.
$38 trillion?
Yeah, we all do.
We all do in so many different ways.
Why don't you buy some Bitcoin or ETH?
Buy some ETH?
I think maybe that's the thing to do.
How do you buy your Bitcoin?
You buy it through an ETF or do you want to own it directly somehow?
We're allowed to own that.
But then you've got to get an air gap.
You can't allow it because people somehow can hack you and steal it.
I like finality as a way, but that doesn't mean there aren't other ways.
But I buy it a lot because I'm very worried about the deficit.
And you think that if there were a financial crisis, Bitcoin would hold up?
Yes, I do.
That it is, as Michael Saylor says?
You don't think it's a proxy for risk?
For risk?
No, I think it's just a nice hedge.
So maybe the crypto market, again, dips severely next week if the Jim Kramer
inverse Kramer investing law holds.
But again, look for the signals long term.
Long term, the plumbing is being put into place.
Breaking news, the SEC approves conversion of Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund
into an ETF.
Congrats to these 10 cryptocurrency projects.
Good for Bitcoin.
Good for ETH.
Good for XRP.
Good for Solana.
Good for Cardano.
Good for SWE.
Good for Litecoin.
Good for Polkadot.
Good for Link.
Good for AVAX.
I personally can see a future where institutions, number one, they're going to
want Bitcoin.
We understand that.
It's like a digital gold.
But other than Bitcoin, I think a lot of institutions will just want exposure,
exposure to the crypto market in some sort of weighted index like this, like others.
So this is just the first, but like this and like what's coming.
And just in, 21 shares, which is one of the companies behind the Bitcoin ETF,
just filed with the SEC for a spot Ando ETF.
And what do we know about Ando?
Ando is the native utility token of the Ando chain, which is a layer one proof of
stake blockchain with a focus on institutional grade financial markets
and tokenized real world assets.
They are tokenizing the traditional financial system.
And Ando also has ties with the Trumps because they are made in America.
The Trump family's DeFi platform, World Liberty Financial, has been a backer of
Ando Finance, having added the platform's token to their holdings.
ETFs generally take a long time to get approved.
This may be months or years away.
I will keep you updated.
In crypto gaming news, we have another announcement, another fund backing
which I'm an advisor for.
TBV is backing EverReach Labs, the gaming studio rewriting the rules of player
spectator interaction, meaning streamers like these games because streamers
audiences can have a say in this, make it more interactive.
Led by a team of builders behind Far Cry, Fortnite and Rainbow Six,
they're launching a full stack ecosystem powered by Ever.
And reasons this crypto game is different is building.
Their first title, Revenge, turns viewers into game changers built for Twitch.
It's the first co-op player versus environment extraction shooter where
spectators influence every match in real time.
It's top 10 on Epic Games, TwitchCon 2025 partner and backed by Magic Media
and Immutable, the chain.
So interesting to see what smart money is taking positions in.
And I will say this was an update from CoinMarketCap, but they say EverReach
Labs is updating their token ticker from Ever to EverX, meaning just something to note.
And if you like the Avalanche AVAX blockchain, you'll love this.
This is a growth milestone.
Blackhole DEX, which is a DEX on Avalanche, has crossed $175 million in total value locked.
They're less than about a week old, meaning people looking to make money in crypto
farm yield, so to speak, put their coins in some of these pools and farm yield.
That's growing.
We see here the fees being generated.
And of course, some of this goes back, goes to buy back super tokens,
superverse tokens, as this is part of the superverse ecosystem.
That is the video.
My name's Austin.
Don't forget to take advantage of the promotions.
Get a $20 deposit bonus immediately, meaning put in $100, you get $20 back.
Put in $1,000, you get 20% of that back.
Only with code altcoin at a limited time if you're a crypto trader on Exchange Partner WeEx.
And like always, see you tomorrow.
