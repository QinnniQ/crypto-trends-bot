There's a certain paradox in digital innovation, an endless drive towards connecting the world
while clutching at the last threads of privacy.
This is particularly true in the realm of Web3, where innovation thrives, and yet, vulnerability
lurks at every turn.
Each transaction, time stamped and etched into the transparency of public blockchains,
leaves a trail that is both a mark of progress and a perilous crack in the armor of privacy.
Recent headlines reveal the extent of these fractures.
Think of the staggering $1.5 billion siphoned away by North Korean hackers, or the crippling
aftermath of 16 billion credentials exposed in a breach, scattering personal data across
an already fragmented digital landscape.
And these events aren't anomalies, they're signposts, stark reminders of the critical
vulnerabilities plaguing the intersection of online commerce and personal identity.
Public blockchains are celebrated for their openness, their promise to decentralize trust.
But that visibility is a double-edged sword.
Wallet addresses transform into unguarded windows, and transaction histories act as
diaries open for anybody to read.
Even the smallest breadcrumb, a dusting of activity on an address, can lead bad actors
down a trail that ends in tragedy.
The very ledger that empowers us to interact without intermediaries also lays bare our
digital selves, exposing the silent truth that on-chain transparency often comes at
the price of privacy.
These challenges strike at the heart of what it means to operate in a connected world.
How do we reconcile the utopia of a decentralized future with the risks of unguarded exposure?
For innovators like Giorgi Corelli, the answer lies not in compromise, but in reimagining
the architecture altogether.
Henkel Wallet strives to make privacy the default.
Not a privilege, but a right.
A multi-chain privacy layer where transactions become whispers in the wind.
A world where, as he puts it, they can't hack you if they can't see you.
With privacy becoming an urgent question rather than an afterthought, we stand at a crossroads.
A moment to decide if our trust in Web3 can grow stronger through solutions that protect
rather than expose.
Joining us today, Giorgi Corelli invites us to reconsider the balance between innovation
and intrusion, security and freedom.
We peel back the layers of this challenge, uncovering not only the technical feats required
to ensure privacy, but also the philosophical depths of why it even matters.
Because in this era of omnipresent surveillance, the act of safeguarding one's digital self
is no longer just a security measure.
It's an assertion of freedom, an act of defiance.
Welcome to the Defiant Podcast.
Hello everyone, welcome back to the Defiant Podcast.
I'm your host, Vinnie, and I'm here with Giorgi Corelli, who is the co-founder and CEO of
Henkel Wallet, a Web3 privacy solution looking to build a multi-chain privacy layer for
blockchain technology.
Thank you so much for being here.
Thanks for having me.
All right, so let's jump right in.
Can you share a little bit about your background and what led you to focus on privacy wallets
and decentralized coordination within crypto?
Yeah, absolutely.
I'm originally from Georgia.
I was born in Georgia, and I started my career as a professional wrestler.
I was twice world champion in wrestling, then I moved to investment banking, spent five
years and tried five.
Then I moved to the US, I did my MBA and master's at Stanford, and at Stanford we started with
Web2 initially.
In 2021, actually what happened is it was a crypto boom, so 90% of regular startups
became crypto startups.
Because Stanford did also ZK Hub, as you know, Dan Bernays from Stanford, so a lot of cryptography
is happening there.
And it was a huge movement and also educational development of all sides of crypto, right?
So people finally started understanding what is the end goal of crypto and how it can be
more efficient than financial rails.
And I already had five years of experience, so I knew that you need at least like 11 intermediaries
to move money from one country to another, and this can be done peer-to-peer with close
to zero cost on public blockchains.
So that was the vision, but then what I also realized that public ledgers and public blockchains
have very strong network efforts, that it's very hard to substitute, right?
Ethereum is not the most ideal architecture type of system, but it's strong because it
was one of the first, so it had first mover advantage.
And it only accrued network efforts afterwards.
So then I started being concerned if new public chains can have the same traction as Ethereum,
and like will it be possible to substitute traditional financial rails with something
like Ethereum and UVM ecosystem?
So and then with having this in mind, right?
Like when we think about traditional system, privacy is very fundamental value of the systems,
right?
From one banking account to another without revealing your data, and this is your trade
data like that, you prefer to keep private all the time, otherwise you'll be compromised,
you can be hacked, and there are many negative externalities that can happen with that.
So Hinkle builds privacy on top of public chains that you never feel.
So it's like embedded in your wallet stock, it can be embedded in your payment stock,
and that's our goal, to fully obstruct privacy on public chains.
And so you've mentioned the phrase, they can't hack you if they can't see you.
Can you expand on how privacy wallets make this concept possible?
So yeah, of course, I think the good example, pro forma example here is a Bybit hack.
So they saw the signers with safe multi-sake, they can read the IP and metadata of the signers,
but they were able, so like North Korean hackers, right, they were able to compromise their
machines and then hack, you know, whatever, like 1.5 billion.
So they saw this data and thus they were able to compromise whatever stock they had.
But if they didn't see anything, it would happen, it wouldn't happen.
So that's the ultimate goal, right, to have privacy.
So you cannot see individual data of the wallets, of the signers.
And no one can actually hack you because there is no possibility to track it down to individual
wallet level.
Yeah, I've always felt kind of weird about the fact that, you know, you can look at someone's
public address and know exactly how much ETH they have and what NFTs they have, like it's
kind of a weird concept to have that much information out there and anybody could see
it.
And it's one thing if it's your friends, but it's quite another thing if someone sees there's
a treasure trove, you know, and they might direct that attack right at me.
So Hinkal is described as an invisible wallet for every transaction.
Can you tell us what makes the wallet invisible?
How does it work?
Yeah, so, you know, initially, like before we actually started Hinkal, the first version
of it was the DAP.
And the problem with the DAP system is that you need to do extra steps to enable privacy.
So in our case, it was, you know, you had to deposit to our vault.
So it worked similar to vault, you create additional address there, and then you have
limited functionality to transact on DAPs.
And you could do like Uniswap, Uniswap, Odos.
And the problem we started seeing is, you know, okay, who are the ultimate customers
of privacy?
First is liquid funds, second is payment networks, right?
For liquid funds, you want to hide your strategy.
For payment networks, you want to hide sender of transaction most of the time.
Also recipients, mostly for payrolls and B2B payments.
And for this, it was like sub-efficient system because it was not embedded in your day to
the activities.
You had to do extra steps.
So then we thought, okay, we already built this.
We had 250 million volume in the system, mostly coming from liquid funds.
So we thought, okay, how can we make it more scalable so we can actually obstruct this
need to move your money to another DAP and also obstruct the need to manually integrate
those DAPs that, for example, liquid funds need because, you know, payments also go after
DeFi, if we think about it, right?
Because DeFi enables additional yield for the embedded stablecoin system.
So that's why what we thought, okay, like, what are the technologies that develop now
that will enable this transition?
And then what we saw that actually TEs became more secure.
So for example, this could solve the problem of proving.
So they can prove generation because otherwise it was clunky and it was taking anywhere from
20 to 50 seconds to prove on client-side machines.
So now, okay, we realize that TEs became secure.
We can actually delegate proof generation to trusted execution environments.
And then it can be instant, right?
Okay, this problem was solved.
And then we used a couple more primitives that we saw in the boom of AI, right?
We used AI to understand if the DAP needs pyramids.
So AI can actually tell us, tell the smart contract, right?
If this DAP needs pyramids and then it can actually route to the right smart contract
inside the DAP.
So you know, and I mean, second is AI and the third is stealth addresses, right?
Stealth addresses serve for privacy of recipient.
And then you can basically create new stealth address every time.
So this way we obstructed all privacy and embedded it in the wallet stock.
And I think the last point here that we should definitely touch base is compliance.
So compliance that we were using before was still a bit clunky because users needed to
provide KYC data, even though it was private, right?
But then we saw now the abundance of ZKTLS solutions and ZKTLS is a phenomenal solution.
You can take any data from any arbitrary session with your internal system, whether it's banking
or centralized exchange, generate proof of this data and then prove to us that you did
KYC somewhere in internet sometime before.
And of course, everyone did it before.
Right.
Are you on the internet?
So yeah, and that's why now we can actually, we don't need KYC data.
So user can go to whatever account he has, right?
If it's like Revolut in Europe or US, it can be Venmo, and now we use all centralized exchanges.
Generate proof of this data without revealing any data to us.
Right.
And tell us, okay, we did this somewhere internet, please enable privacy for all our transactions.
Okay.
Yeah.
So with ZK, this seems like a perfect combination to really protect ourselves when we're on
the internet.
I'd love to talk a little bit about some of the legacy solutions that I'm seeing, you
know, some companies and even some governments wanting to implement with crypto.
One of them is the kill switch and the other is the air gap system.
Why do you think that these, you know, maybe are not the best solutions for us to utilize
in Web3?
I think they are good solutions, but they are not the most optimal ones.
Because kill switch, air gap solutions mean that you're, like, they're mostly optimal
for Web2 systems, right?
You isolate a perimeter of the system, right?
And that's how centralized system work, right?
Because you have a server, everyone runs on it and it's fully separate from another one,
right?
And, you know, that's why those systems, Web2 systems are not composable with each other,
right?
Because they are built in with different stock, with completely independent purchase.
Right.
And in crypto, you need smart contracts and they're all composable, right?
They compose with each other.
So if you have kill switch for, let's say, smart contract, the droughts, some, you know,
DeFi tokens, like PT tokens for Pendle, right?
So there is no kill switch there because if there is kill switch for Pendle, then the
whole yield will be gone and the whole system will die, right?
But I think kill switch can be a really good solution for something like signatures, right?
For example, when you connect to DAP, you give the DAP certain permissions.
So if the DAP is compromised, then it can drain some money.
So kill switch can enable, you know, some systems to be more efficient on a walled level
because you can just close down every parameter, you know, every signature or for multisig,
if you give certain permissions to people, right, you like kill switch and this person
is compromised, right?
And there are some triggers for that, like kill switch can enable this level of security
there as well. So I don't think they are completely redundant systems, but they are not
super optimal for composable on-chain systems.

And I know the EU last year had some meaningful regulation about crypto.
They have the Data Act where they wanted crypto companies to have a kill switch embedded
into their privacy outline.
Do you think that's something that would be beneficial, like on a regulation level, or
is that something that you think might give governments a little bit too much power within
the Web3 ecosystem?
Yeah, I think now what we see with European regulations is there are two directions.
So first is like fully compliant direction that is mostly focused on payments, right?
Right. And we see like big companies like BVNK, for example, is getting licenses, right?
And it's a European company.
But the other direction is like founders figuring out how to become more decentralized
from this regulation.
And that's probably the most powerful, I mean, the strongest direction in Europe now
because they figure out, OK, how to make sure we're decentralized enough, like what's legal
entities. And we saw recently with Morpho, right, when they created this separate entity,
like benefited token holders and just became more decentralized.
So I am propagating for more decentralized solutions.
And with SkillSwitch, I think for payments, this is a decent solution.
But the payments fundamentally now are centralized.
So if you think about major onrump and liquidity layers, what they do is for privacy, they
aggregate all money on one omnibus account.
And then they send from this omnibus accounts to individual EOAs.
And that's a problematic thing because you have security of all your asset holders on
one account that you control, maybe with multisig.
And that's a big trust assumption.
Yeah, I'm feeling nervous just talking about it.
Yeah, I think that's the next big vector of attack for the hackers, right?
If you think about, OK, centralized exchanges hold a lot of money, right?
And Bybit was hard. And what is the next vector of attack?
Like for big like money pods and its payment systems that hold lots of assets on a
custodial side of it. And then we will think, OK, like this trust assumption should be
eliminated. So we learn based on our mistakes.
Unfortunately, don't we all, unfortunately.
Can you tell us about the new privacy stack in crypto and how it aims to address privacy
challenges within digital finance?
Yeah, I think there are a few ways to think about privacy stock.
First is privacy that we are designing, right?
And it's a privacy stock that is enabled by a few technologies.
It's your knowledge proof for smart contract level privacy and proving that you're the
owner of the transaction.
Then it's TEs, as we mentioned, stealth addresses for recipient privacy, right?
And it's all based on VM systems.
And then there's a second stock, new private stock, which is like fully private chains.
And this stock is still it has to prove that there is a value there that can accrue
because, you know, the problem with this is, you know, to move assets on chain, you
need yield for yield.
You need performance of the chains and you need to be able to attract the builders.
And then there's a problem of this yield.
Right. So you cannot move one side without the other.
Right. Because there's a cold, cold start problem all the time.
That's why currently all these private chains don't have instruction, as well as, you
know, fully private coins.
Right. There's a payment system such as ZKs, right.
They never achieved broader adoption as we saw with all other solutions of whatever
five, seven years ago.
Right. And do you do you think that private blockchains are going to be the future of
enterprise adoption or do you see public ledgers, ledgers evolving to incorporate
better privacy features?
Yeah, I don't think private blockchains will have like significant outcomes in terms
of adoption because they cannot be as performant.
And why would you want private blockchains if you can have same privacy on public
blockchains? Right.
So that's the fundamental problem that I have to solve.
But of course, there are good, there are actually like more compliant blockchains now
that are coming up that I'm excited about.
They don't have privacy on top of the chains, but we can enable privacy.
It's mostly L2s and I think their value is achieved through like bringing a lot of
yield opportunities and stable coin issuers because stable coin issuers can actually
route their money to new yield solutions from tokenizing this off-chain yields.
Right. For example, you can tokenize reinsurance.
It gives you from 8 to 15 percent private debt, 8 to 12.
Yeah, I like the sound of that for sure.
And so there's there's this constant balancing act between privacy and compliance.
Right. How do privacy focused technologies like Hinkal ensure that they remain user
friendly while being mindful of regulations?
Yeah, we thought a lot about compliance and it was always on top of our mind because
we started right after turn education sanctions.
Right. So what a time.
The best time to start privacy solution.
And then like we thought about this from multiple dimensions.
Right. The first dimension is OK.
This is like Ethereum driven dimension, which is proof of innocence.
And I mean, I will explain the TLDR of the system.
You basically have a few assets in the set in the shielded pool inside smart contract.
And then you have compliance like you're using TRM or other systems to check compliance.
And this money, you know, basically stale there for a few days before someone can
withdraw money from there and prove that they are part of this compliance subset that
was checked by the systems.
Right. And we thought about this solution.
We talked to our lawyers as well.
And first, my US lawyers at least think that it's not a fully compliant solution.
Right. Because money then I mean, you still routed money.
They can become dirty afterwards.
Then you have to prove and remove yourself from subset.
And then another thing we didn't like in this solution is that it's always capital
inefficient in terms of because your money is stale there and you cannot do other
transactions. Right. And the whole of crypto is evolving around capital efficiency.
So they're OK. And then we thought, OK, we will introduce a bit higher friction at the
entry point. But then we will enable full composability and freedom of like for any
action afterwards.
So that's what we introduced with our first solution.
It was like you can you could do ZK based KYC.
But then the problem was enterprises wanted to do it, of course, institutions, liquid
funds, but retail people don't want to do it.
So all our flows were mostly institutional or like large whales.
But now, like with Tornado Cash latest updates, we were finally allowed to remove to
allow a very small portion of deposits like, let's say, under one thousand dollars to
be completely permissionless.
And then for everything above, ZKTLS came to place.
So now it's a great solution because you don't have to provide any KYC data to us.
You have full proof that there is no data that you're sharing with us and you're
verifying full compliance, right, that you did KYC with a proper institution.
That's a beautiful solution.
Yeah, absolutely.
Let's let's turn to some of the recent events in data privacy.
You were mentioning one earlier.
We have most recently 16 billion credentials leaked in a recent breach.
Crypto users are understandably alarmed.
So how should users of platforms like Coinbase or custodial wallets strengthen their
on-chain security in light of such incidents that we've seen recently?
I think what we have seen in a series of recent events is that smart contracts just
became better systems than people.
There were no hugs of smart.
I mean, there was like more based hug recently on Sui, but over the past three years,
like, you know, when we just joined crypto, we had hugs every day.
I was reading like smart contract was hugged, non-smart contract was hugged.
Over the past two years, I think, I saw only like maybe two or three hugs, right?
So the systems became super efficient, you know, there are, and if you look at broadly
in not just crypto space, but web, web to space, you could see that there are no net
new hugs, so it's all social engineering.
And, you know, I had this conversation with CrowdStrike CTO and he was like,
you know, there are just no new startups that would take, you know, new spaces in
cybersecurity because no new vectors are emerged.
So same applies to crypto, right?
Why do we need to rely on humans if smart contracts became just better systems?
That's why, you know, I think Coinbase is pushing base now, like, and more decentralized
systems. Same now we see with Bybit, right, with the launch of their DEX and the wallets
that all exchanges are pushing.
I think everyone finally realized that the DeFi and composable systems is the future
and that they cannot build all this in their centralized ecosystems without any
composability with DeFi.
And actually, I think recently Coinbase announced that they finally allowed DeFi from their
centralized exchange UI, so they added more for a few other dubs.
So we see this happening and I'm super excited about this.
Yeah. Do you think there are any lessons that the DeFi industry can take away from the Coinbase
breach specifically?
Yes, that you should not store the data.
I think the problem was there was the data and then these people, right, I think call
send people or customer support, they had access to this data.
And I mean, the summary here is like they probably there should be some guardrails
between the accessibility who can really access and then some security.
But Coinbase has so many security checks, right?
When my investor wanted to move his money to provide TBO to our protocol, he couldn't
do it because Coinbase required like to have a call in a week from then.
Like then they only allowed like one-tenth of withdrawal.
So they already do this.
So I think, you know, again, right, this more decentralized solution such as ZKTLS imply
that almost no one has data, right?
So just like removing call access and letting users to provide as much data as they want,
right, is the outcome here.
Why do we need so many KYC solutions?
Everyone asks KYC, right?
You go to the bank, you need KYC, centralized exchange, KYC.
Yeah, and it's, you know, very weird to be, you know, buying your crypto on a place like
Coinbase and they won't give it to you until you show your driver's license, your ID.
It's like, wait, this is like so not crypto in how it feels, you know, until you get it
off of the exchange.
So, yeah, I'm definitely excited to see how we can not only better protect ourselves,
but also like make the whole journey feel very Web3 versus, you know, sometimes it feels
like we're teetering between Web2 and Web3 just to get to the use cases that we're talking about.
So Tether's CEO recently criticized cloud-based storage following these leaks as well.
Do you think fully decentralized or local storage solutions like
PairPass offer a real solution?
And what are the trade-offs?
Yeah, I think it's a decent solution for crypto market.
And if you think about like enterprises like Coinbase, they might use the solution.
But it can be offered as one of the alternatives because having like
hardware-based solution implies that you're relying on this hardware.
And most of people are not, you know, the most efficient systems, right?
Again, there's a theme here.
And, you know, I never lost my phone actually, but everyone lost, you know, his or her phone.
Some point of, you know, the lifetime.
So I think that's a problem we cannot trust ourselves.
So how can you trust your hardware that stores the keys?
And then if you're not super tech savvy, you will never export these keys
or you can write the seed phrase, then you place it into 10 different accounts in the banks.
So it becomes like super complicated.
So I think we cannot avoid cloud-based systems.
And I think the net benefit of cloud-based systems is still quite higher than the damage
that we received because cloud enabled so many different things, right?
The whole Google was enabled by cloud, right?
What if sending crypto felt more human?
Pulse just launched Red Packets, a new way to give tokens with meaning.
It's gasless, gamified, and claimable inside group chats only.
Think AirDrops meets social cues on chain.
Backed by smart wallet tech and live across major L2s, Red Packets turned communities
into micro economies of gratitude and growth.
No seed phrases, no friction, just connection with value.
Check it out at pulse.social.
So you have advocated for decentralized coordination as a pathway to ensuring privacy.
How does this work practically for end users and organizations looking to adopt models like this?
Yeah, so privacy, what is on public chains, depends on anonymity set.
And anonymity set is number of assets inside smart contract
that provides privacy for every incremental user who joins the set.
And just to describe in more simple way, yeah, you come, let's say it's,
we have 10 users, 10 million worth of smart contract, right?
If you come with 100 million now, and then you do like Uniswap swap,
like you swap from USDC to ETH, there will be no anonymity or privacy for you because
like everyone looking at smart contract will recognize that
there's like this depositor probably did the same transaction, right?
Even though what appears on chain is our smart contract.
So that's why this coordination is important.
So we have to make sure that there are enough incentives for every newcomer
to participate and there's sufficient anonymity set for that.
But then for this anonymity set, right?
The system allows to build it, but also participate in the routing of transactions.
So every user can become a real heir and participate, stake our future tokens,
we don't have tokens yet, and be able to route this transaction on external DApps.
So they participate in the upside, aggregate these tokens, right?
But then they also have incentives to be private
because of these tokens and the benefits they receive.
That's a coordination there that we describe about privacy
and network effects that it brings, right?
So every new user benefits more from the smart contract that they joined.
Right, right. That makes sense.
So we're seeing an increase in the amount of like phishing attacks
and data leaks that are happening, I would say even just in 2025.
Do you think that the crypto ecosystem is prepared for mass adoption?
And are there still major security hurdles that we need to overcome
to really prepare those new users to use crypto?
Yeah, I don't think it's necessarily only crypto
because I think the problem with crypto is we have lots of people who got quite rich.
And this money sitting in their wallets, it's quite anonymized
because it's very hard to touch their names.
But then it's actually easy to figure out who are these people
based on the history of their interactions with DeFi.
For example, if you were early in curve during the inception of their DApp
and you were a contributor, you could figure out during token generation event
how much this person would receive.
And then there's the assumption that he stores this money somewhere in the wallet.
And then bad actors actually go after these people.
And this is quite a big problem to solve because it's fully public,
everyone knows this information now, and there are criminals going after them.
And we saw this happening with lots of different crypto founders,
mostly including Ledger co-founder, I think he had a problem with criminals in France.
But I don't think this is a major problem.
The major problem is EI now because EI can do deep fakes.
Yes, getting better every day.
And we saw this few problems happening with also crypto investors,
with Zoom calls when they share the...
Yes, yes, I'm definitely very wary of any links that come my way,
but it's frustrating when you're like, I'm just trying to have a business call.
Or you think you're going on a business call and here you are now watching your wallet drain.
So yeah, I think that there are a lot of just new attacks, same kind of technology,
but different pretenses.
So I'm seeing lots of people who are deep into crypto,
have been in crypto for 10 years and they're getting hacked too.
So it's not even necessarily a lack of awareness or being new to the space.
It's just this constant bombardment of attacks.
I think it's lack of best practices of security because
if you're in crypto for 10 years and never got hacked, you might be lucky, right?
You're a unicorn.
You're in the lucky 95%, but it's still a huge amount of people.
And then you don't separate two machines like where you store hot wallet from the ones that
you take calls, right?
So you might not even have 2FA for some of your solutions.
So I don't think this necessarily means that most of crypto people are
very security conscious and that's a big problem.
Yeah, we need to get more paranoid of our interactions online.
So if user privacy becomes the default, it becomes the norm,
how do you see this reshaping the broader financial ecosystem both in and outside of crypto?
So crypto privacy and with private wallets can really become the entry point for lots of people
now because if you can enter crypto in a fully private manner where no one can see you,
no one can really attach label to you, this becomes a no-brainer solution.
And now the question is how could it become a no-brainer solution?
And I mean, it all depends on user experience.
If you have the same experience as you do during on-ramp or adding assets to your wallets,
this is the most beautiful solution for you to use.
So this can enable new users to join such as institutions moving assets on-chain
and avoid problems such as dusting.
For example, when Franklin tokenized lots of funds,
that's a big problem that they had like a lot of shit tokens just
coming to their wallets and smart contracts itself.
A lot of new institutional enterprise players can join.
So finally, you can move money and send to your friends, your employees,
without them seeing your on-chain data.
And I think the future of this is actually solving the problem of omnibus accounts
because these payment systems need these better solutions.
So they can also aggregate these funds but add some yield to it.
But now, in isolation of this fund, they cannot attach any yield-generated solutions.
Sounds like a win-win to me.
More security and yield?
I mean, yes.
So how do you think that enterprises can prepare to integrate privacy wallets
into their operations without disrupting their existing workflows?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I mean, the first question that we start to answer is,
what are their workflows?
And their workflows are very new.
So that's what they're adopting right now.
I don't think there is an enterprise that is doing on-chain transactions
for the past seven years, right?
Probably some employees and team members there, but not on a mass scale.
So that's why it's very new stock.
Some of them do, you know, fire blocks for wallet creation.
Then they do, I don't know, bridge for on-ramps.
And then they tokenize funds through securities, right?
Or they go to their competitors.
So the market is quite fragmented.
And there are no leaders in this space, but all the solutions work in a similar manner.
So in our case, I think the biggest problem here is
bringing just a bit new primitive to them, right?
Because these users are by default the most skeptical users about new tech, right?
Like the banks.
Why the banks are the worst B2B customers for every startup?
Because it's close to impossible, right?
To have a business with them, like it takes years.
But I think the beauty of current moment is
that we have this new playbook that actually Charge GPT showed to the world.
And it's called, you know, it's like PLG v2.
So PLG is product-led growth, right?
When thinking about notions like, you know, got users,
like customers, employees just use the solution.
They realize how beautiful is the solution.
Then they go upstream and upsell to the enterprise level, right?
What Charge GPT introduces is a bit different playbook,
which is you go to consumer, you show the value, everyone loves the product.
And after that, they start selling to developers through APIs, right?
Same applies to the best crypto solutions, right?
You have to start first with showing the real value
and preferably based on consumer traction, right?
Then you can go up upstream to institutions, enterprises,
and show the solution on the development side, right?
With APIs SDK, so you can enable privacy in a programmatic way.
So that's what we are actually doing now.
We are releasing like browser extension that feels like the best wallets and extensions there.
And then we also have developer documentation.
It's very grassroots.
It's like building the demand first and then moving up.
That makes a lot of sense.
Because why create a complex solution when nobody's asking for it?
It's going to be very hard to sell, right?
So we've talked a little bit about crypto privacy best practices.
I was wondering if you had any tips or advice
that you can give to our more intermediate advanced crypto users?
Yeah, for intermediate advanced, I think the biggest ones now is that
they can finally trust ZK.
And ZK has become the efficient solution, right?
That especially coupled with some other solutions such as DEEs, NPCs,
there are some advancement there with Snarks systems, also Stark systems as well.
So I think like using hardware and hardware wallets also became more secure.
So I think that the next big thing that we will be enabling is using
hardware wallets for proof generation.
And you have the whole stock that belongs to you.
You have proof generation on hardware wallets and signatures as well, right?
You have full privacy of your data.
You privately move assets on chain.
And then you never need to off-ramp because you can pay in stable coins for everything, right?
And that's a perfect world that hopefully will happen soon, but it usually takes time.
But starting early and moving assets on chain is, I think, the first tip that
will help you to get to the best primitives.
And I think what I'm also excited now is crypto cards.
Yes.
Crypto cards became so phenomenal because I'm the heavy user.
And before being a US person, I didn't believe that crypto cards will provide significant value
to me because I already have exposure to stable coins and I don't have devaluation of my local
currency.
But then I realized that in crypto, you can build so many primitives and wrap the asset
in stable coin.
That provides underlying yield worth of 10%, 11%.
And then cash back.
So now I'm having 11% on my current account with 3% cash back.
So I spend all my money in crypto on a daily basis with my MasterCard.
So this is phenomenal.
So I think most people don't know it yet that they can do it.
So I think this is pulling lots of retail people to crypto, right?
Because this is unavoidable now.
We will have always higher yield in crypto cards versus traditional banking.
Well, especially when traditional banking is like, here's 0.1%.
You're welcome.
It's like, what?
That's not even beating inflation.
So I think just the fact that so many crypto products are creating this yield,
it's just going to be more attractive to everyday users, to investors of all shapes and sizes.
Well, this has been wonderful.
Can you tell our audience where they can find you and where they can learn more about Hinkle
and all the privacy solutions that you've been discussing with us today?
Yeah, absolutely.
Twitter, Georgia Corelli, Gagel, Hinkle Protocol, but it's now Hinkle.
And we also use other solutions.
We are big on LinkedIn as well because LinkedIn, a lot of institutions are there.
And that's awesome.
Thanks for having me.
It was an amazing conversation.
Thanks so much for coming in.
And we'll see you guys next time.
