The SpotBitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have been incredibly bullish for crypto.
Since their launch, the SpotBitcoin ETFs have played a key role in driving BTC
to new all-time highs. And it looks like the SpotEthereum ETFs are now having the same impact on
ETH. As you watch this, both ETFs are seeing massive inflows, which could take BTC and ETH
even higher. And this has everyone wondering which are the best ETFs to get exposure to BTC
and ETH. And that's why today we'll be covering everything you need to know about the biggest spot
crypto ETFs. My name is Nick and this is a video you cannot afford to miss.
Before we begin, you need to know that I am not a financial advisor and nothing in this video should
be considered financial or investment advice. This video is purely educational and intended
to inform you about the leading SpotBitcoin and SpotEthereum ETFs on the market. Now we've all
heard SpotBitcoin ETF being thrown around as crypto's biggest buzzword, but it would probably
be useful to understand what this actually means. ETF stands for Exchange Traded Fund and it works
pretty similar to shares in a company. The difference is that instead of representing
part ownership of a business, an ETF share represents a portion of a fund that contains
assets like stocks, commodities, or in this case, cryptocurrencies. A spot ETF basically means that
it's backed by actual crypto that's held at a custodian, rather than a derivative of the crypto
like its price, which is what futures ETFs do. Obviously, ETFs come with their own pros and cons.
On the one hand, they're generally more regulated than the crypto market. Investors also don't need
to worry about setting up an exchange account or dealing with self-custody. But of course,
this is a double-edged sword. If you're not buying that crypto directly, then it technically doesn't
belong to you. As the saying goes, not your keys, not your coins. In this case, the crypto in the
ETF technically belongs to the issuer, not to you. It's also extremely important to note that ETFs
aren't the only ways you can gain access to crypto in a regulated way. There are also similar products
that we'll touch on in today's video, namely ETPs. And ETP stands for Exchange Traded Product and
this is the umbrella term that includes spot ETFs, among other things. If you're based in the US,
spot ETFs will be the most accessible. You can typically buy them through most major brokerage
platforms like Interactive Brokers, Charles Schwab, etc. etc. Just like regular stocks.
However, due to the differences in crypto regulation around the world, crypto ETFs aren't
available to everyone. If you're in the EU, you won't be able to directly invest in crypto ETFs
listed on US exchanges. As such, some asset managers have created alternatives in the form
of ETPs, but we'll point those out a bit later as we go along. And if you're in the UK, the bad news
is that unless you're a professional investor, you can't buy crypto ETFs or even crypto ETPs.
Thankfully, the Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, is currently considering lifting the retail
ban on another type of Exchange Traded Product called an Exchange Traded Note, or ETN. An ETN
is a specific type of ETP that's issued by a financial institution and is designed to track
the performance of an index. Similar to futures ETFs, ETNs don't actually hold the underlying asset.
Instead, the issuer pays the return of an index, minus any fees at maturity.
Okay, with all of that out of the way, let's dive into the top 3 spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. But
before we do, fire up those like buttons if you enjoyed this video so far and don't forget to
subscribe and ping the notification bell to make 100% sure YouTube sends you the notification when
another video is uploaded. Back to the vid. The first spot Bitcoin ETF you need to know
about is the biggest and that's BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, or iBit for short.
As most of you will know, BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with Total
Assets Under Management, or AUM, recently hitting a record $12.5 trillion, which is frankly mind
blowing. What you may not know though is that BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink, was once a Bitcoin
skeptic. In 2017, he referred to Bitcoin as quote, an index of money laundering. His stance had
changed by 2022 though, when Fink said quote, I was a skeptic, I was a proud skeptic, but I studied
it, learned about it, and realized my opinion five years ago was wrong. Respect. In June 2023,
BlackRock filed with the SEC to convert its iShares Bitcoin Trust into an ETF using Coinbase as its
custodian. Other asset managers like Grayscale and ARK Invest already had pending applications,
but the SEC hadn't responded. Once BlackRock applied though, investor optimism surged because,
well, it's BlackRock. And what BlackRock wants, it usually gets. The SEC subsequently approved 11
different spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, and BlackRock's iBit quickly outpaced its competitors.
In fact, iBit became the fastest growing ETF in history. According to data from Glassnode,
when iBit began trading on the 11th of January 2024, it held just 227 Bitcoin. Within a single
week, these holdings had grown by more than 100 times to roughly 25,000 BTC. A month into iBit's
launch, BlackRock's Bitcoin stash had reached over 82,000 BTC. And by six months, it was holding a
staggering 313,000 BTC. Pretty crazy stuff. And this momentum has stayed relatively consistent
ever since, albeit with occasional sulling here and there. At the time of shooting, BlackRock's
iBit controls over $85 billion in AUM, holding over 717,000 BTC. Now, aside from BlackRock's
stellar reputation and its status as the world's largest asset manager, a key factor behind iBit's
early success was its temporary fee reduction, from 0.25% to 0.12% on the first $5 billion in
assets during the first year. However, that promotional period has ended, and iBit's fees
have now reverted to 0.25%. But where can you actually invest in iBit? Well, for US investors,
you can access iBit just like any other stock on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange by using a regular
brokerage platform, just like the ones we mentioned earlier. If you're in Europe,
though, things get a little bit trickier. iBit isn't directly listed for retail purchase,
but BlackRock launched a spot Bitcoin ETP for European investors called IB1T. In the UK,
however, it's only available to professional investors until the FCA lets retail get access,
protecting investors from accessing the world's most successful ETF ever. Bravo, chaps.
Okay, the next ETF you need to know about is the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, or FBTC. Fidelity
is another one of the world's leading asset managers with around $5.9 trillion in AUM.
And what's crazy is that Fidelity actually started researching crypto way back in 2014. Fidelity first
applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF back in 2021, but the application was rejected by the SEC in January
2022. The asset manager then reapplied for the ETF in June 2023 with a division of Fidelity itself
acting as the custodian, specifically Fidelity Digital Assets. Much like iBit, Fidelity's FBTC
has seen exponential growth since it launched on January 11th last year. According to estimates from
Glassnode, FBTC was holding roughly 25,000 BTC within its first week of launch. Within a month
from launch, these holdings had shot up to 60,000 BTC. And by six months, this had increased to
roughly 161,000 BTC. Today, Fidelity's FBTC controls over $2.16 billion in AUM with over
206,000 BTC. Not too shabby. Now, like BlackRock's iBit, the Fidelity-wise origin Bitcoin fund has a
fee of 0.25%. US investors can buy FBTC through virtually any brokerage or trading platform in
the US that provides access to stock exchanges, including directly through Fidelity. However,
European and UK investors won't be able to access FBTC directly. Thankfully though,
Fidelity also has an alternative Bitcoin ETP called FBTC, which trades on major European exchanges.
For the UK, professional investors can access FBTC on the London Stock Exchange. Oh, and by the way,
if you're looking to buy crypto directly, then you need to check out the Coin Bureau deals page.
That's where you'll find sign-up bonuses of up to $100,000 on the best exchanges,
trading fee discounts of up to 50%, and cashbacks on deposits of up to 75%.
You see, these deals, well, they won't be around for long, so take advantage of them ASAP using

about is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF or GBTC. Grayscale's ETF is much smaller than either
BlackRock or Fidelity's, with just $33 billion in AUM. Unlike many of its peers though, Grayscale has
focused solely on cryptocurrencies since its founding in 2013. In fact, Barry Silbert created
the firm to offer investors exposure to crypto without managing the underlying assets themselves.
Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust was actually launched way back in 2013, originally as a private placement
available only to accredited investors. It became available to retail investors in early 2015.
Without getting too technical, trusts are like spot ETFs in that they are backed by physical assets.
The difference is that the issuance and redemption of shares in trusts doesn't happen as frequently
as with ETFs, and the result is that the price of the trust shares can trade above or below the value
of the underlying assets, hence the premiums and discounts on GBTC in the past. Grayscale first
applied for its GBTC trust to be converted into an ETF in 2017, but faced rejection from the SEC,
which cited fears about market manipulation and investor risk. And this continued even after
Bitcoin Futures ETFs launched in 2021. But this was odd since the presence of the Bitcoin Futures
ETFs meant that the SEC could trust the market's pricing of BTC. So when the SEC refused another
ETF application in 2023, Grayscale responded by suing the regulator, and then they won the case.
Without this major catalyst, it's questionable whether any spot Bitcoin ETFs would have been
approved in 2024. As with the other spot Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC finally approved Grayscale to
convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF in January last year. And just like BlackRock, Grayscale is
using Coinbase as the custodian for this BTC. But while IBIT and FBTC flew out of the gates,
Grayscale's GBTC struggled early on. After converting GBTC into an ETF, major outflows forced
Grayscale to sell large volumes of Bitcoin from its reserves. Many believed this created sell
pressure that suppressed Bitcoin's price. A few months later, it was revealed that a large portion
of those outflows came from FTX, which liquidated around $1 billion worth in GBTC holdings as part
of its bankruptcy proceedings. So once that unique event wrapped up, many expected GBTC to start
seeing more and more days of net inflows. However, this wasn't the case. To put things
into perspective, Grayscale's Bitcoin trust held over 620,000 BTC before being converted from a
trust to an ETF. As you can hopefully see on the chart provided, the holdings of the ETF have been
shrinking ever since. Today, GBTC only holds around 222,000 BTC, roughly a third of what it
started with. Naturally then, this begs the question of how GBTC has remained as one of
the biggest Bitcoin ETFs, even with these consistent outflows. And the answer is a combination
of Grayscale charging a much higher fee than its competitors and a dedicated base of investors that
continue to show unwavering support for an asset manager that, despite all odds, refuses to cave in.
To put things into perspective, Grayscale charges a fee of 1.5%, and that's six times more than
Fidelity or BlackRock. And this has helped Grayscale to draw in more revenue than all of its
competitors combined. US investors can buy Grayscale's GBTC using most major brokerage
platforms and trading accounts. Unfortunately for European or UK residents, direct exposure to GBTC
is unavailable at this time, and Grayscale has yet to create an alternative ETP that's more
accessible to international investors. Okay, now that we've seen the top three spot Bitcoin ETFs,
let's now shift our attention to the top three Ethereum ones. Unsurprisingly, the biggest one
comes from BlackRock, and that's the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, or ETH. BlackRock first
filed for the Ethereum ETF in November 2023, again choosing Coinbase as a custodian. The
SEC eventually approved spot Ethereum ETFs in May last year for several asset managers,
including BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK21 shares, Invesco, Galaxy,
and Bitwise. Unlike the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the spot Ethereum ETFs didn't immediately start trading
the day after they were approved. Instead, they began trading two whole months later,
on the 23rd of July 2024. Now, it's no secret that the spot Ethereum ETFs haven't matched the
success of their Bitcoin counterparts. Institutional adoption has been slower than expected,
leading to a rocky start. In their first few months, they flip-flopped between net inflows
and outflows, ultimately failing to offer ETH the same price support that the Bitcoin ones gave to
BTC. Spot Ethereum ETFs didn't see significant net inflows until last November, but these were
short-lived, often followed by outflows that essentially reset the playing field. As you can
hopefully see on this chart provided, this volatility subsided by February, when activity
flatlined in the negative. The trend reversed though, in April this year, with a surge of
record-breaking net inflows since. So, how has BlackRock's ETH-A performed?
Well, despite challenges in attracting lasting investment, its ETH holdings have nonetheless
grown impressively. GlassNode data shows that just a month after trading began on July 23rd,
ETH-A held 332,000 ETH. By year's end, that number had ballooned to over 1 million ETH.
Today, it controls more than $6.4 billion in AUM and holds over 2.1 million ETH.
Just like with its Spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock charges a 0.25% fee for trading ETH-A. And it's
worth noting that the firm reportedly met with the SEC's crypto task force in May to discuss Spot
Ethereum ETPs with staking features, although the SEC has yet to give this the green light.
For what it's worth though, the recent approval of the staked Spot Solana ETF suggests Ethereum
is next in line. Now, while US investors will have no issue buying ETH-A, European investors
don't have the same luxury. Unfortunately, at the time of shooting, BlackRock has yet to reveal
any plans to create a Spot Ethereum ETP in the same way it created an ETP alternative for its
IBIT fund. For what it's worth though, there are plenty of other European ETPs available from other
issuers in the UK and the EU. Now, the second Ethereum ETF that you need to know about is
Fidelity's Ethereum Fund or FETH. Fidelity first filed with the SEC for its Spot Ethereum ETF
in March last year. As with FBTC, Fidelity Digital Assets serves as the custodian for the assets
held in FETH. Notably, Fidelity's initial SEC filing was initially amended to include a staking
mechanism. A few months later though, Fidelity amended the filing again to take the staking
element back out. But, as you may have guessed, Fidelity is again seeking to add a staking mechanism
for its Spot Ethereum ETF. However, in April this year, the SEC delayed its decision to allow these
features to be implemented. Fidelity's Ethereum Fund began trading on the 23rd of July last year,
and by the end of the year, it had already amassed over 462,000 ETH. Today, FETH holds almost
570,000 ETH, with over $1.2 billion in AUM. If you're wanting to trade FETH, Fidelity charges a fee
of 0.25%. US investors can freely trade FETH, but Fidelity hasn't yet announced any plans to create
an ETP alternative to its Spot Ethereum ETF for international investors, at least at the time of
shooting. Okay, the third Spot Ethereum ETF you need to know about is, you guessed it, Grayscale's
Ethereum Trust with the ticker ETHE. The Ethereum Trust originally launched in 2017, with its primary
purpose being to hold ETH and provide investors with exposure to the second largest crypto through
a regulated financial instrument rather than direct cryptocurrency ownership. Initially, ETHE shares
were only available through private placement to accredited investors, but were made available to
retail investors in the US in mid-2019. So, yes, it's literally the same playbook as Grayscale's
Grayscale first filed with the SEC to convert ETHE into an ETF in October 2023, just a few months
after it beat the regulator in court. It began trading as an ETF on the 23rd of July 2024,
with Coinbase again serving as custodian. Grayscale's Spot Ethereum ETF performance has
mirrored its Bitcoin ETF, with significant outflows since launch. And this has frustrated many
investors, as inflows into other Spot Ethereum ETFs were largely offset by heavy ETHE outflows.
At conversion, the fund held over 2 million ETH. Today, it holds just over 570,000 ETH,
about a quarter of the original amount, with around $3.8 billion in AUM. Notably, Grayscale
also created the Ethereum Mini Trust as a more cost-efficient alternative to the larger Ethereum
Trust ETF, with fees of just 0.15%. And what's fascinating is that this actually means that the
Ethereum Mini Trust has the lowest fees of any Ethereum ETF, the exact opposite of Grayscale's
Spot Bitcoin ETF. Like other asset managers, Grayscale is also seeking SEC approval for a
staking mechanism to be added to its Ethereum ETF products. Now, surprise, surprise, Grayscale also
doesn't have any Spot crypto ETPs or any other product suitable for EU or UK residents, which is
undoubtedly very frustrating. But as I mentioned earlier, there are other Spot crypto ETPs from
different asset managers you can consider. Those looking for Spot Bitcoin exposure can of course
use BlackRock's IB1T that we mentioned earlier. Alternatively, another example is CoinShares
physical Bitcoin ETP, which uses the ticker BITC. At the time of shooting, it holds just
under $2 billion in AUM and charges a fee of 0.25%. As for exposure to Ethereum, one example is 21
shares, which actually offers an Ethereum staking ETP that uses the ticker AETH. It holds over $450
million in AUM, offers a staking yield of 1.52% and charges a fee of 1.49%. And this is just the
tip of the iceberg. Beyond the Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs covered here, several Spot altcoin
ETFs are also in development, some already active. These could supercharge the prices of their
respective cryptos. So if you want to stay updated, then check out our altcoin ETF update video right

This is me, Nick. Thank you guys very much for watching and I will see you again soon.
