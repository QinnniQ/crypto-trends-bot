Let's start by rewinding to the bear market.
Spanning from late 2021 to 2024, this phase was characterized by significant downturns in cryptocurrency prices,
investor skepticism, and regulatory uncertainties.
It was during these trying times that DeFi's foundations were tested and strengthened.
During the downturns, the total value locked across all DeFi protocols plummeted from $180 billion,
all the way down to $30 billion, a massive drop of almost 85%.
Ethereum, the backbone of DeFi, faced its own set of challenges.
While remaining the most popular and the most decentralized, the network struggled with scalability issues.
The community eagerly awaited the merge and broader adoption of Layer 2 solutions
with the promise of greater scalability and efficiency.
Despite launching in the depths of the bear market, emerging L2 platforms, such as Arbitrum and Optimism,
immediately began offering lower transaction costs and improving the overall throughput of the Ethereum ecosystem.
These innovations were not just a stopgap, but a preview into a future where Ethereum could scale efficiently to meet increasing demand.
The growing adoption of L2s posed its own challenges for the Ethereum ecosystem,
mainly the fragmentation of liquidity and lack of composability between different scaling solutions.
Meanwhile, other ecosystems presented a different approach.
Solana, for instance, known for its high speed and low transaction costs,
doubled down on its monolithic design narrative.
This started attracting a different set of developers wanting to build cheaper and more composable applications.
Solana gained significant market share despite its ecosystem being hit particularly hard by the bear market and the collapse of FTX.
The bear market also revealed the shortcomings of multiple centralized players.
This ranged from SIFI lending platforms, such as BlockFi and Celsius going under,
to centralized exchanges like Coinbase Binance and Kraken struggling with regulatory pressure.
It's worth remembering that most DeFi protocols worked exactly as expected during the same period.
Users could trade on DEXs, lend and borrow on DeFi lending platforms,
use liquid staking protocols and more without relying on centralized players.
This situation showed us that despite its challenges,
DeFi offers a unique value proposition driven by its transparency, auditability and decentralization.
The previous bear market was more than a period of decline.
It was a period of evolution, setting the stage for the next chapter of DeFi.
Emerging from the bear market, one thing became obvious.
Despite the vast majority of already established DeFi protocols remaining the leaders in their own categories,
a set of new protocols took the lead in the new market sector or tried to challenge the incumbents.
In the Ethereum ecosystem, Uniswap further ingrained itself as a go-to decentralized exchange, capturing most of DeFi's volume.
The Uniswap team announced a new version of the protocol, Uniswap v4, in June 2023.
The new version introduces a powerful new tool for developers called Hooks
that provides a way to inject custom logic right into a liquidity pool's lifecycle.
Uniswap v4 is being developed in the open with the community and is expected to launch soon.
Aave, the biggest lending protocol in DeFi, has surpassed $30 billion in net deposits across 13 different networks.
The team behind Aave also introduced a new decentralized stablecoin called Go.
Users can borrow the Go stablecoin on Aave at a cheaper rate than the other more established stablecoins, such as USDT or USDC.
Speaking about stablecoins, another established DeFi protocol, Maker, iterated on its design
and started introducing innovative types of collateral, including US Treasury bills.
This contributed to the emergence of another narrative in the DeFi space, known as RWA, which stands for Real-World Assets.
Maker has been recently rebranded to Sky.
In the derivatives space, Synthetix introduced v3, completely overhauling the protocol from scratch.
With v3, Synthetix became a layer of liquidity on which any derivatives market can be built.
Outside the established DeFi protocols, a new wave of players joined the emerging staking sector.
Lido, with over $30 billion in staked tokens, established itself as the biggest liquid staking protocol.
However, Lido has recently seen a lot of competition from a plethora of newer protocols, including Rocketpool, METH and Coinbase ETH.
Another adjacent sector, called restaking, has also emerged outside of staking.
In short, restaking allows for reusing Ethereum validators to secure a completely different network or protocol.
Eigenlayer, a leader in this category, has accumulated over $14 billion of TVL.
This, in turn, created a liquid restaking market.
EtherFi, a key player in this category, amassed over $8 billion in liquid-restaked ETH.
Athena, Morpho and Pendle are other protocols that rose to prominence during the bear market.
Each one accumulated over $3 billion in TVL and became leaders in their respective categories.
Athena allows users to create synthetic dollars with internet-native yield.
Morpho specializes in creating efficient lending primitives with permissionless and isolated market creation.
And Pendle allows users to benefit from fixed, rather than fluctuating, yield in DeFi.
Staying in the broader Ethereum space, we saw a lot of DeFi development on L2s, which de facto became their own ecosystems for DeFi experiments.
Arbitrum, with over $18 billion in TVL, positioned itself as a go-to place for DeFi activities.
GMX, a decentralized spot and perpetual exchange on Arbitrum, stands out as one of the new protocols that gained traction during the bear market.
BASE, an L2 build on top of the OP stack, has also seen a big increase in DeFi activities.
The TVL on BASE has recently crossed the $10 billion mark, making it the second biggest L2 by TVL after Arbitrum.
On BASE, Aerodrome became the biggest DEX despite facing competition from Uniswap.
Other L2s, such as OP Mainnet, Blast, Linia, ZKSync, Starknet, and Scroll, also continued their development, trying to find their niche and compete for users' and developers' attention.
Outside of the Ethereum ecosystem, DeFi protocols on other L1s also went through a defining period.
On Solana, DEXs and DEX aggregators, such as Orca, Radium, Jupiter, and Drift, emerged from the depths of the bear market.
They started handling more and more volume, fueled by the memecoin mania, they even surpassed DEXs on Ethereum.
Pump.Fun established itself as a go-to platform for launching new memecoins and, despite recent controversies, contributed to a large volume of transactions on Solana.
In the lending space, Kamino started rapidly growing its TVL, recently reaching over $2 billion.
New innovative protocols, like Gito, emerged, combining liquid staking with MEV rewards.
One of the most pivotal moments for the Solana ecosystem was the Gito airdrop, which ignited significant interest and attracted substantial capital, especially from speculators anticipating future profitable airdrops.
It is often compared to the Uni airdrop invigorating Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem in 2021.
There were also DeFi protocols that decided to launch their own chains.
This was particularly visible in the resource demanding trading space, with exchanges such as DYDX and Hyperliquid being the prime examples.
As we reflect on all of these developments, it's clear that this period was not just about recovery.
It was a period revolutionizing the way we think about decentralized finance, a true DeFi renaissance.
At the time of this video, the total TVL across all DeFi has rebounded to approximately $120 billion.
While still below the all-time high of $180 billion, this marks a significant recovery from the $30 billion low, highlighting the resurgence of the DeFi space.
Now, as we head into 2025, let's dive deeper into upcoming innovations.
In the Ethereum ecosystem, we expect DeFi activities to continue moving into L2s.
These new networks will continue to play a pivotal role, enhancing Ethereum's capabilities and allowing for greater transaction throughput.
Driven by the additional data availability space, we can expect to see even more L2s launch in the future.
The competition in the L2 space is fierce, and projects will try to differentiate themselves in various ways.
Outside of the Ethereum ecosystem, Solana, with its high-speed and low-cost transactions, will carve out its own niche in the DeFi space.
One of the big upcoming events in the Solana ecosystem is the launch of Fire Dancer, a new validator client built by Jump.
The aim is to increase Solana's throughput, resilience, and efficiency.
Similarly to the competition in the Ethereum L2 space, we can already see a plethora of L1s coming to fruition.
Projects like Aptos, Sui, and SEI all compete with Solana for being the fastest blockchain.
We also have some highly anticipated new players joining the competition, such as Monat, which specializes in parallel execution,
Berachain, which uses proof of liquidity as a consensus mechanism,
and Sonic, a revamped phantom chain optimized for speed and efficiency.
Tokenization is another big area for DeFi yet to conquer.
This space, although discussed pretty much since the inception of the crypto industry, has so far been hindered by regulatory uncertainties.
It's hard to predict exactly when, but I would expect to see the vast majority of assets in the world eventually being tokenized and tradable in DeFi.
This would include stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and other financial assets.
Finally, DeFi innovations are unlikely to slow down.
We can expect continued advancements in areas such as enhancing the speed and resilience of DeFi infrastructure,
improving user experience through better wallet designs and simplified cross-chain transactions,
and exploring crossovers between DeFi, AI, and gaming.
As we venture into 2025, the DeFi landscape presents a remarkable picture of resilience, innovation, and growth.
After the bear market and being stifled by unclear regulation,
DeFi has not only recovered, but has also paved new pathways for financial technology.
Key protocols, such as Uniswap, Aave, and Sky, have endured and evolved,
introducing advanced features and signaling robust growth in the DeFi ecosystem.
The rise of L2s with projects like Arbitrum, Base, and OP Mainnet marks another frontier in scalability and user adoption.
Outside of Ethereum, Solana and other new innovative L1s compete for user attention, trying to increase their market share.
In conclusion, as DeFi continues to mature and develop,
it stands at the forefront of redefining the financial landscape,
bridging gaps and creating a more interconnected and accessible financial ecosystem for years to come.
It's going to be fascinating to continue watching how this journey unfolds.
