Crypto is famous for its 100x returns, but many believe these kinds of returns are no longer
possible. Well, this couldn't be further from the truth. Many cryptos have hit 100xs in recent
years and not just meme coins. With altcoins starting to wake up, now is the time to go hunting
for the next 100x gems before they take off and you'll have a higher chance of finding them if you
know where and how to look. That's why today we're going to tell you exactly where and how to look
for the next 100x altcoin. My name is Guy and unlike an invitation to a billionaire's private
island, this video is something it would be unwise to ignore. Okay, first things first,
you need to know that nothing in this video is financial or investment advice. It's just
educational content intended to help you find altcoins with potential. And if you want to get

that notification bell. Okay, now I want to start with an example of a crypto that recently rallied
by 100x to prove that these kinds of gains are still possible to find and that we know how to
look for them. So, last year the AI niche was in the spotlight and towards the end of the year
the AI agents narrative started getting attention. That's when a crypto project called Virtual's
protocol started to go parabolic. Without getting technical, the Virtual's protocol makes it possible
to create AI agents. These AI agents then trade against the Virtual token which creates demand
for Virtual every time an AI agent is traded and there was lots of trading. The result was that the
Virtual token rallied from five cents to five dollars, a 100x return. Notably, it took less
than three months for Virtual to rally by 100x, specifically from mid-October 2024 to late December
2024. This is concrete proof that a 100x return is not only possible but can happen very quickly.
Now, believe it or not, but our research team here at the Coin Bureau discovered the Virtual's
protocol months before it rallied by 100x. One of our researchers first heard about it in May 2024
and told our Coin Bureau club members about it in October, weeks before it went parabolic. Now,
obviously not every crypto our research team found went up by 100x, but we've identified
dozens of cryptos with 100x potential over the last couple of years. And now that altcoin season
looks like it's finally around the corner, we believe that many of our altcoin picks could see
similar returns to Virtual very soon. We're honestly glad that we have such a long list because
there may not be much time left to find more. And this begs the question of where you can find
all this altcoin alpha, and the answer is the Coin Bureau club. That's where you'll find all the
cryptos that we're betting on in the coming months, weekly reviews of promising small cap altcoins,
daily updates about emerging trends and narratives, and real-time discussions with
elite members of the Coin Bureau community and even the Coin Bureau team. So, if you don't have
the time or capacity to research altcoins yourself, then be sure to become a member
of the Coin Bureau club using the link below. Just make sure to hurry because the club will
soon be undergoing a massive upgrade along with a membership price increase. So, if you sign up
shortly after this video goes live, you'll lock in the members rate for life. So, check it out,

the first thing you need to do is figure out which niche is likely to get big in the coming
months and which narratives within this niche will be easiest for investors to understand
and allocate to. Now, it's important to note that these are two different things.
For context, a niche is an umbrella term that applies to a crypto category like tokenized
real-world assets or RWAs. Narratives, on the other hand, are specific themes within a niche
like tokenized real estate. When a crypto niche like tokenized RWAs gets big, the cryptos that
belong to the narratives that are the easiest for investors to understand are the ones that
tend to have the highest potential for returns. The catch is that identifying the next top niche
and the best narratives within it is just half the battle. Recall that the cryptos you find also
need to be easy for investors to allocate to. This means that they either need to be listed
on exchanges like Binance or Coinbase or exist on chains that are cheap, fast and accessible
like Solana, Sui, Hyperliquid and Base. Remember, less accessibility means less inflows.
This begs a bigger question though and that's how you can figure out which niches will become
popular and which narratives within these niches are the most digestible for investors.
In our experience, the answer is to look at which niche or chain is popular now and what the logical
sequel will be. For example, at the time of shooting, Ethereum is very popular. That's
because there's been lots of excitement around the stablecoin niche ever since the Genius Act
became law in the US and most of the stablecoins in circulation exist on Ethereum. This helped
to attract attention and capital to ETH which combined with a short squeeze to create a massive
rally that's hopefully still ongoing as you watch this. The caveat is that there are also niches that
can be thought of as being native to each chain. In Ethereum's case, that's DeFi which is part of
why DeFi altcoins on Ethereum rallied alongside ETH when it pumped. Of course, the use of stablecoins
in DeFi was another contributing factor in the DeFi pump and this is extremely important to point
out because it not only gives us a sense of which niche is going to get big but which
chain this niche will be focused on. To quickly recap, ETH is now rallying because of FOMO around
stablecoins and DeFi is rallying due to their dominance in Ethereum's ecosystem and the fact
that stablecoins are used in DeFi. In other words, we have two niches in play, stablecoins and DeFi.
So what other niches are related to stablecoins and DeFi? Well, the first one that comes to mind
for us is tokenized RWAs. That's because most tokenized RWAs trade against stablecoins and many
of them are likely to be used in DeFi either as something to trade or as collateral for stablecoin
loans. Logically, this means we need to figure out which chains are popular for tokenized RWAs.
Well, according to rwa.xyz, the top five are Ethereum, ZKSync, Solana, Aptos and Stellar.
We'll use Solana for the purposes of this example because it's a perfect example. To bring you up
to speed, Solana recently launched permissionless tokenized stocks on its chain. These are now being
integrated into its DeFi protocols. This suggests that capital is likely to rotate into Solana's
ecosystem after it's done playing in Ethereum's ecosystem. Lo and behold, we saw evidence of this
recently. The moment that ETH started chopping for a few days, capital started rotating into
Solana's ecosystem, causing SOL to rally above $200. So here's another question. What niche is
popular on Solana that's related to things like DeFi? That's right, meme coins. Wouldn't you know
many meme coins on Solana started rallying the moment that SOL started pumping? It's important
to note that a part of this pump was just because most meme coins trade against SOL. So when SOL's
fiat value rises, so does theirs, even without any buys. Now, final question. What niches are related
to meme coins? Well, in this case, the first one that comes to mind for us is NFTs because many
meme coins also launch NFT collections as a means of increasing token utility and engaging their
communities. As it so happens, NFT collections on Ethereum and Solana recently started rallying for
the first time in years. Is that a coincidence? Well, let us know in the comments. Anyways,
once you've figured out which niche is likely to become big and which chains it's likely to be
focused on, the next step is to look for narratives within this niche that are easy for investors to
understand. There's no real hard and fast rule on how to do this, just use your imagination.
One example I used earlier was tokenized real estate for tokenized RWAs. Now, we actually covered
a tokenized real estate RWA project on Solana for our Coin Bureau Club members that seems to have
serious potential. Reminder that the link is down below. Anyhow, another example of a narrative
that's easy for investors to understand is a decentralized bank account or a decentralized
savings account which would fall under the niche of DeFi. Similarly, cat meme coins could become
a narrative in the meme coin niche simply because it's a logical follow-up to the dominance of dog
themed meme coins. I know it's not logical, but logic is not enough. You know what I mean.
And that reminds me, niches like meme coins and AI have likely seen most of their gains in percentage
terms for this cycle because many of the narratives within them already pumped a lot in 2024. To be
clear, this doesn't mean that meme coins and AI cryptos won't rally, it just means they're likely
to rally less compared to other niches. But again, it's less so about the niche and more so about the
narrative. In the case of AI, many cryptos in the AI infrastructure narrative have already seen most
of their gains for this cycle. By contrast, you could argue that AI agents still haven't experienced
a proper rally, especially now that new narratives are emerging around the fusion between AI agents
and DeFi, known as Deef AI. Decentralized hedge funds and decentralized personal assistants
could still become very big narratives. In any case, the key takeaway is that you want to ask
yourself what themes investors would have the easiest time understanding in different crypto
categories. If you're struggling to come up with ideas, try thinking about the similarities between
crypto niches and their Web2 equivalents. Specifically, try and think of things that
are likely to be familiar or intuitive to the average person in those sectors.
Take GameFi, for example. Now it's essentially the same thing as regular gaming, but with crypto
incentives thrown in. Chances are that the most popular GameFi games will be those that are the
most similar to games that the average person is already familiar with or could easily understand.
Minecraft comes to mind. And to make sure you've actually chosen a narrative that's easy for the
average person to understand, ask yourself this question. Is this something that my mum or dad
would understand and invest in? If the answer is a firm no, it's probably not a good narrative.
If the answer is yes, then you're probably on the right track and I'll repeat that they must be able
to also easily invest in the crypto in question. Otherwise, it's pointless. Now, once you've got
yourself a list of narratives that are easy to understand and fall under niches that are
likely to become big, then you can finally start looking for cryptos that fall into these narratives.
As you might have guessed, this is the hardest part because searching for things like
decentralized Minecraft doesn't usually give you very good results. There is, though, one useful
tool that can help you with this. Grok. That's right, Grok, the AI that's free to use on X.
You see, most AIs are horrible when it comes to researching crypto. That's because an AI is only
as good as its data and there is a lot of bad data out there about crypto. Think sponsored or
biased articles, outdated documentation and so on. The interesting thing is that the majority of the
most up-to-date information about crypto can be found on X. Case in point, many of the articles
you read on crypto media websites like Cointelegraph will have an X post as their source. Newsflash,
but Grok is integrated directly into X. This makes it the ideal AI to research crypto with,
at least among the free options. We're sure there are probably better paid services out there.
Regardless, asking Grok about things like which GameFi game is the most similar to Minecraft
is a good starting point to get a sense of where to look, but it's worth repeating
that you can't just pay attention to the coin or token, you also need to pay attention to the chain.
If you find a decentralized Minecraft crypto on some old and dusty blockchain that nobody
uses and is hard to access, it probably isn't going to do all that well. More importantly,
you need to pay attention to the market cap because that's what ultimately determines
how much a crypto could pump. Now some would say the Sandbox is an example of a GameFi crypto
that's like a decentralized Minecraft and we would tend to agree. The only problem is that
Sand's market cap is already $800 million. Not to burst anyone's bubble here, but Sand probably
won't pump by 100X. That's because this would give Sand a market cap of more than $80 billion
and for reference that would make it bigger than Cardano and Hyperliquid combined and that is
extremely unlikely to happen. As a rule of thumb, an altcoin needs to have a market cap of less than
$100 million to have a chance of hitting a 100X. That's because a 100X increase in a market cap of
say $10-20 million works out to just $1-2 billion. Now if you've been around since 2021, you'll know
that there will be hundreds of cryptos that hit market caps in the single digit billions at the
peak. Right now there's only about 80. This means there are likely to be dozens of altcoins that are
currently less than $100 million that will reach market caps of $1 billion or more in the coming
months. It goes without saying that you can't predict exactly which altcoins will 100X,
but if you filter by niche and then by narrative and then by chain and then by market cap,
chances are you'll realize there are only a few dozen cryptos that have a chance of realistically
hitting a 100X, particularly if you take the time to do the research. We would know we've literally
researched hundreds of cryptos over the last two years that had potential at first glance,
but only a few dozen did upon closer inspection. And this brings me to the biggest question of all
and that's which altcoins have 100X potential? Well the honest answer is that we don't know for
sure, but there is something that we've noticed while researching promising altcoins. The altcoins
with the most potential appear to exist primarily on Solana and Base and it makes perfect sense if
you think about it. Solana and Base are both fast, low cost and easily accessible chains.
Solana can be easily accessed via the Phantom Wallet, whereas Base can be accessed via Coinbase's
Base app. And not only that, but Ethereum's and Solana's ecosystems are the largest and most
active by almost every metric, be it active wallets, stablecoin volume or total value locked.
As we've seen, users and capital tend to go where most users and capital already are. Put
differently, Ethereum's and Solana's ecosystems are likely to remain dominant
for the remainder of this cycle. To be clear, this doesn't mean that altcoins in other ecosystems
won't rally or can't 100X. It's almost guaranteed that there will be many, but the thing is that they
will be much harder to find and the likelihood that they achieve astronomical gains will be
much lower. At the end of the day, crypto is fundamentally a game of chance. With limited
capital, you want to be very strategic with your bets. There's a huge silver lining here too,
and that's that if it's true that most altcoins with 100X potential exist on Solana and Base,
then it narrows down the list of narratives and altcoins even further. That's because there are
arguably only a handful of niches that are central to Solana and Base, such as meme coins, tokenized
RWAs, AI agents, PayFi, and potentially GameFi. SocialFi seems to be an emerging one as well.
It also makes it easier to identify exactly which altcoins will do well. Altcoins with the closest
connections to key players in Solana and Base's ecosystems will probably outperform other altcoins
that are similar, and yes, we have found many of these in our research as well. They're not that
hard to find if you pay attention. Just look and see which crypto projects these key players are
following and promoting. Better yet, listen to interviews with these key players and see
what crypto projects they mention. You'll be surprised at how many promising altcoins you'll
come across and the kind of alpha you'll get. It turns out that people often say a lot when you
give them a microphone and just let them speak. With enough research, you'll have as much alpha
as the insiders, and will have a better sense of whether you should buy or sell.
