Tokenization is an innovation.
We believe the next step going forward
will be the tokenization of financial assets.
And we at the SEC should be focused
on how do we advance innovation in the marketplace.
And you probably saw last week,
Chairman Atkins of the SEC
gave an interview about tokenization.
He called it a great innovation.
The rules have not been clear.
We've had regulations through enforcement.
That day is over.
And we agree with that.
We think tokenization is perhaps the biggest innovation
to come into capital markets in the past decade.
And that means every stock,
every bond will have its own basically QCIP.
It'll be on one general ledger.
Tokenized stocks are the fastest growing
individual assets right now, mostly on Solana.
We see all these stocks tokenized,
Tesla, Robinhood, NVIDIA, the S&P 500 and Apple,
all are exploding with growth.
And they all chose Solana.
Solana's the NASDAQ of the future.
That's what they wanna be.
They wanna be that.
There's a common misconception
that Solana was built to kill Ethereum.
Absolutely not.
Tulli was way more ambitious than that.
He wanted to kill NASDAQ.
And this is a talk about how we're gonna do that.
So as the growth continues,
how much will 10 Solana coins be worth by 2026?
I think someone said earlier
that running Solana validators is like driving F1.
Highly competitive, everyone's tuning.
Watch today's whole video.
He wanted to kill NASDAQ.
And this is a talk about how we're gonna do that.
Like the video, get this information out there
because in fact, Solana is the fastest growing chain
overall for tokenized stocks.
We see the network, Solana, up over 185,000%
in the last 30 days, followed by base,
that's Coinbase's layer two on Ethereum,
followed by Algorand, followed by Arbitrum,
followed by Ethereum.
So if you can manage to accumulate say 10 Sol tokens,
how much could that be worth by the end of 2026?
And do we have any clues, any signal
that helps us understand
if the growth trajectory will continue?
Because right now, Solana's economy is booming.
They are one of the fastest growing chains.
In fact, they have over $1 billion plus in app revenue
for two straight quarters,
over 3,200 plus monthly active developers.
This is the latest network health report
with all the details.
This shows application revenue by chain.
In the green is Solana, in the bluish purple,
the light bluish purple is Ethereum, but green Solana.
The growth is undeniable.
In fact, right here is where Trump launched his meme coin.
On Solana, the president of the United States
chose to launch on Solana.
Of course, we're gonna have a cool down from that local top,
but you see the general direction.
Also in anticipation of this upcoming market structure bill,
the Clarity Act, which will decide which altcoins
are commodities or securities.
Commodities better, we want commodities.
And for order for an altcoin or a blockchain network
to be declared a commodity,
we have to determine if that blockchain network
is efficiently decentralized.
For the latest data, Solana remains
one of the most decentralized proof of stake networks
by node count and distribution
with over 100, 1,295 validators across 40 countries.
Solana's Nakamoto coefficient of 20 outperforms Ethereum 6.
The Nakamoto coefficient essentially tells us
how decentralized is your blockchain.
Solana is winning over Ethereum
and no single country or data center
holds more than 33.3% of active stake.
And also looking at development activity,
developers are the lifeblood of Solana
and dev growth is accelerating.
Solana was the number one blockchain
of new developers in 2024
with over 83% year over year growth.
Solana is in the lead followed by Ethereum,
also internet computer, app dose, base blockchain,
all near the top, but Solana in the lead.
And how I know that Solana still has more upside
because you could say Austin, Solana is already winning.
Am I too late?
It seems like Solana metrics are really looking good.
I wish I would have found this earlier.
By the way, subscribers of Altcoin Daily
did find this earlier, much earlier.

But one reason out of three that I know we're still early
is because seven Solana ETFs by major firms
with trillions of dollars in assets
have not been approved yet.
I mean, Invesco Galaxy alone filed for a Solana ETF,
they have over $1.8 trillion in assets under management.
They're global, they're a global investment firm,
as well as Fidelity with over 800 billion plus
in assets under management are also waiting approval.
Both of those companies along with others
filed and got approved
for the first ever Bitcoin spot ETFs.
And we saw what happened to price.
We saw just a couple of weeks ago,
the SEC went to all the issuers
that have filed for these Solana ETFs
and basically said, come back to us,
refile your prospectus documents,
include staking language.
And I think for them,
they're knocking out two birds with one stone.
One, it's a new asset class
and two, they can see the type of language
that they wanna put in these documents for staking
and they can work on that.
If we're gonna get Solana ETFs launched,
they're gonna launch out the gate with staking
is my base case this year.
Seven Solana ETFs have still yet to be approved,
but Bloomberg ETF analysts updated their latest odds
of approval for crypto spot ETFs
with baskets and index funds.
Litecoin and Solana are leading the pack
at 90% approval odds in the year 2025.
So while I think Solana truly becoming
the global decentralized NASDAQ, that's years away.
I don't think that'll happen by 2026.
That's gonna take building.
I do think that if my thesis plays out
that Bitcoin will lead this market
and will continue to go up,
maybe hit 150, 170, $200,000 per coin
by end of year or beginning of 2026.
I do think 10 Solana will be much higher by 2026.
If the Bitcoin price can hit,
let's say $150,000 by end of year,
I think Solana can easily do a 2X, at least hit 400, 450.
So that would bring the price of 10 Solana to $4,500.
Of course, if the Bitcoin price can hit closer
to $200,000 per coin, $250,000 per coin
by the end of 2026,
that's when this market starts
to get a little bit more frothy.
I think used assets, meaning assets with product,
market fit, where we're seeing the fundamentals
go up and to the right will do well.
I could see the price of one Solana token
between 600 and $700 per coin in a frothy market
where it touches there.
And then we correct for six months, eight months
in the standard bear market.
That would bring the price of 10 Solana to $8,000 in total.
But the true value of what Solana is aiming to be
is much bigger.
He wanted to kill Maddeck,
and this is a talk about how we're gonna do that.
If this comes into fruition,
what could 10 Solana be worth?
Well, let's ask an expert,
one of the main builders on the Solana network,
Max Resnick, speaking at Token 2049,
about Solana's path to decentralized NASDAQ.
So we developed the core Agave client,
which runs most of Solana.
And today I'm gonna talk about what the future
of the tech in Solana is.
Number one, Solana can't crash all the time.
You can't have a decentralized NASDAQ on a network
like Solana if it crashes when it gets super active.
So the first step is, of course, increasing bandwidth.
So while the bandwidth or transactions per second TPS
of Solana today is around 1,200,
Visa is around 7,400, and the NASDAQ,
although it's completely centralized,
is around 70,000 transactions per second,
the future of Solana will be a million transactions
per second, and here's the path.
And we've committed at Anza to be at a million TPS
by the end of the year, and we wanna keep doubling,
or sorry, not a million TPS, 100 million CU
by the end of the year,
and we wanna keep doubling that every year.
And that's our commitment,
and there's a lot of really smart people working on it.
And the other major thing to understand
is that people trading use the NASDAQ to buy and sell,
to trade, they're just gonna use the most global,
efficient system that has the most liquidity
with the cheapest fees.
If you have a network that incentivizes a better order book
and order book depth, that network will win.
The thing we really need to do to compete with NASDAQ
is to provide better prices than NASDAQ.
And what do we mean by better prices?
We mean this little gray interval here,
we want that to be as tight as possible.
So I'm showing SolUSDT on Binance from earlier this month,
and yeah, we have some crazy volume crypto,
so you can see that the prices don't really match up
with what they are today,
but this was from maybe two or three weeks ago.
And in the middle, there's the difference
between the best bid and the best ask,
and that's the spread.
And that's really the price that you're getting.
And if we want people to use Solana over NASDAQ,
we need to give them a better price than NASDAQ.
So all this is multi-years in the making,
five years, seven to eight years.
Think where the price of Bitcoin may be
in five to eight years.
To determine what the price of 10 Solana may be
in that five to eight year timeframe,
let's just look at the standard numbers
that is projected that the global tokenization market
will grow to.
These are pretty standard,
whether it's about, this is rounded,
but 22.3% a year or 21.5% a year.
It's growing, that's the point.
It's going to be bigger.
And while right now global tokenization
is around 6 billion, very low,
by 2033, it's projected to be about 29 billion.
29 divided by six is about a 5X, let's round up,
because I think at that time, as we're growing,
as crypto goes into its renaissance,
we will get periods of hypey, frothyness in markets as well.
So dare to dream, let's round this up to 5X.
That means I think the price of Solana
in that five to eight year window could be 5X larger.
That puts the price of one Solana
just under $1,000 per coin,
and of course puts the price of 10 Solana
at just under $10,000 per coin.
Is this jaw-dropping?
Do you think this is an under-representation
or an over-representation?
Maybe let's add on meme coins,
just like now the official Trump meme coin.
Maybe we get that, that whole market opens up.
Maybe it's closer to 1,500 or closer to $2,000 per coin.
