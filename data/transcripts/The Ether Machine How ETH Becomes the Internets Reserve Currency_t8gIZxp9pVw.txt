What is ether? Ether is the commodity to the future of the internet. Ether is the fuel for
every computational step necessary to process a transaction on the future of the internet.
Bankless Nation, very excited to introduce you to our next guest. We have Andrew Keyes,
we have Dave Marin of the Ether Machine. How are you guys doing?
We're great. Thanks for having us on. Thanks.

What are you guys starting on? How much Ether do you guys have right now?
So we're anchoring this with 169,984, which is basically the amount of validators divided by 32
of mine, and we are going from there. Okay.
Yeah, I think the press release announced the plan to, at current prices, to be more than 400,000
Ether. More than 400,000 Ether is square one, base one, number one for you guys. Day zero.
And how do you get there? How do you get from the, did you say 169? Okay. Yeah, 169,000. How do you
get to 400,000? Is that net new purchasing coming in? So that's a great question, and I think that
this is a key differentiating point. We've seen others say that they own ex-Ether, but with an
asterisk, that that's an in-the-money call option, and we are not going to be employing
in-the-money call options for our exposure. What is an in-the-money call option?
So basically one buys a call for Ether to, that it's basically above a certain price
at a certain date, and they basically take the cash amount of that delta, and they consider that
Ether exposure. But because we believe Ether is a productive asset, and we are going to be generating
our alpha, actively managing that for public market investors, in-the-money call options leave
yield on the table. And if you were to consider this like the Ether ETF is like a stock without
having access to a dividend that one enjoys. And so we could employ call options as proper
risk management, but the majority of our strategy, like the well-overwhelming, let's call it 99% of
our strategy is around the active ownership and yield generation of Ethereum.
So some of these other treasury companies are doing this via call options, and you're saying
it's going to be like straight purchase of pristine Ether in the Ether machine. But so
continue that line of thought then. So you've got 170,000 now or so. How do you get to 400,000
of that clean, pristine ETH that you're putting on your balance sheet?
So part of our raise has been in-kind contribution, and part of it has been dollars.
And the in-kind contribution is being contributed right now as we speak. The first part of our
raise was through a private placement, and capital is due today, Friday, July 25th. And that will
immediately be staked and be generating Ether. And then the dollars that come through our private
placement will be used to acquire spot actual Ether, not call options, and to be actively
risk managed, generating yield through staking, restaking, and eventually through DeFi strategies.
I had a question about how other treasuries are doing this. And recently, it was very interesting
to me, Tom Lee's outfit. I'm going to forget all the acronyms. David helped me out. BNMR,
is that the one? BNMR, yeah.
Okay. Yeah. I knew there was a B because it was formerly Bitcoin. Okay. So Tom Lee's outfit,
they added another, I want to say, was it 200,000 ETH, 300,000 ETH? It's all getting lost. About a
billion dollars worth of ETH just this week. Okay? They just bumped up. Now they're above
500,000. We'll show the strategic ETH reserve where everyone can kind of track this for the
latest. How did they buy or get a billion dollars worth of ETH in one week without the price moving?
I mean, what were we, David? Up 9% on the week? That's a price move for ants. I mean, like a
billion in purchases and we only move 9%. I don't understand where that's coming from.
So I'm not here to talk about other companies. I believe that we're all playing on the same
team with Team Ethereum. But a way to have exposure to Ethereum without moving the price
would be call options. But does that count? Does that count on like the strategic reserve
treasury website? It's a derivative. Will it be ETH in the future?
Well, then if one were to have a call option, they would earn dollars and then would have
dollars later to potentially buy Ether, potentially buy more calls. I can't opine for another strategy.
But one way to have exposure to Ethereum without necessarily having the price move,
but also not being able to participate in the yield generation or really help the network
by securing it and validating transactions would be through call options.

I'm going to talk about the machine word because the machine word in the ether machine seems to be
doing a lot of work here. My interpretation of this is that your company is building
what you are calling a machine that just produces more ether, hence the ether machine.
Talk to us about this name and then tell us how does one build a machine that produces ether?
Let's pop open the hood and tell me what the components look like and how ether comes out
the end of it. I think this really dovetails nicely
with what Andrew was talking about the importance of acquiring pristine ether. To us,
ether is not just a treasury asset, it's working capital. It's kind of the fuel for our reactor,
is ethereum itself. We view the ether machine as a machine to produce additional ether.
This is kind of why we have assembled this diverse team of deep ethereum experts
to generate the optimal amount of ethereum on our ethereum base or ethereum reserve.
That's why we have folks like Tim Lowe, who is our CTO, who was the initial founder of
consensus staking, has been staking since the very inception of proof of stake.
Folks like Darius Pritzel, who's been deep in D5 for years, being core contributor to blue chip
protocols, etc. We kind of have this team of deep ethereum experts that's going to be focused
full-time in-house on generating the optimal amount of ether we can generate off this base,
obviously in a risk-adjusted fashion. Yeah, make no mistake, we are ether heads and
we want to see the ethereum protocol grow. To that extent, we want to employ ethereum as much
as possible. Back to this call option example, we want to be staking ether so we can secure the
network and be a benevolent part of the ecosystem. We want to restake ether so we can use ethereum's
proof of stake security for other middlewares. We want to employ DeFi so we can actually be a
contributor to the decentralized financial economy. But at the same time, with this public vehicle,
we now have the opportunity to explain to Wall Street and Main Street what ethereum is.
This is going to be the first time our banking partner is Citibank. It's the largest investment
bank on earth. Say what you will about investment banks, this is going to be the first time you're
going to see real sell-side coverage creating reports quarterly. What is ethereum? What is
staking? What is restaking? What are the DeFi protocols? We're going to use this opportunity
to educate Wall Street top down and Main Street bottom up about the power of ethereum. As I
understand it, ether is this unique asset in comparison to bitcoin as it relates to being
productive. Bitcoin, it's got this great narrative, 21 million units, hard cap, easy to understand. I
think that's what's propelled microstrategy to its highs. But as a reserve asset specifically,
employing this same sort of strategy, ether is pretty unique, specifically due to its
productivity. There's a particular resonance that a productive asset has, a productive
store of value reserve asset has for this type of strategy where we are accessing the capital
markets, taking on debt to go and buy a store of value reserve asset to put it on the balance sheet.
Bitcoin is not productive, it's inert. Ethereum is highly productive. You can use it inside of
ethereum's DeFi. You can stake it and get a yield. You can restake it and add more yield on your yield.
I don't know if you guys are doing this, but you can put it into Aave and access stable coins and
get yield. There's all these variety of opportunities that ether as a productive asset has,
which lends itself very well to having this sort of core business that you need to have in order
to pay off the debt that you took on in order to buy more ether. Am I over the target here, Andrew?
Is this what you guys are going to do? Are you going to put ether into DeFi?
You nailed it. First and foremost, we need to thank Satoshi for her contribution to the world
creating Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the opening act. It is awesome. I was asked on CNBC if I own a Bitcoin
and I said, no, I actually own 0.18, which is a little bit of dust, so I do own some Bitcoin.
I found that out afterwards. I recall seeing that clip and I recall you saying,
why would I own a flip phone when I can own a smartphone is what you said, right?
I'd rather have an iPhone than a landline. Bitcoin is great and it can serve its singular
use case. On the Bitcoin blockchain, there's one asset, Bitcoin, and it does one thing,
send. One asset, one send. Ethereum, conversely, is the infinite machine. We can digitize any asset,
a bar of gold, a barrel of oil, a stock bond derivative, a stablecoin, and then we can have
infinite functionality. Rather than just send, we can create smart contracts that we can just
imagine. Basically, any if-then-else statement can be codified on top of Ethereum.
Furthermore, and to that point where Bitcoin, you need the hardware, real estate, and electricity
for proof-of-work mining, Ethereum has an exponentially more efficient consensus mechanism
where all you need is the Ether and to be a benevolent actor that's self-interested
to earn yield via proof-of-stake. Ether has this intrinsic yield that we can employ through
staking, restaking, and proof-of-stake. I believe it's a better asset for public market exposure.
And furthermore to that, so that's like, let's call it the DeFi side of the house.
And then you talk about the TradFi side of the house. We believe that MicroStrategy did
create from inception a very interesting concept of what we would consider a positive sum game.
Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and we can sell the volatility of Bitcoin as MicroStrategy
to hedge funds that want to buy volatility and use those proceeds to acquire the asset of Bitcoin
as for the shareholders that want exposure to that asset. And that's why
I believe there is a multiple TNAB, is the ability to access those public debt markets.
That, in my opinion, is a positive sum game. The good news is that Ether is double the volatility
of Bitcoin. So if you liked Bitcoin as a volatile asset, hedge fund X, Y, Z, you're going to love
Ether. If you liked Bitcoin as a buy and hold treasury asset, you'll probably like this one
with yield, shareholder. So I think that this is just a better mousetrap when compared to
the MicroStrategy Bitcoin buy and hold. You talked about the intrinsic yield that
Ether gets because of how Ethereum works, right? Ethereum, of course, it doesn't have proof of
work. The way that Ethereum secures itself is with proof of stake, which means if you hold Ether,
you do a little bit of work for the network, and then you get the Ether inflation that comes out
of the network to secure it. And then we don't have to have all the costs of the electricity
and all the baggage that comes with proof of work. It's very, very beautiful, very elegant.
One of the things that Ethereum has invested in and researched in since its inception in 2015.
That's not the only place that Ether gets intrinsic utility and intrinsic demand. Something that
pills many people, like me and Ryan specifically, is Ethereum's own internal DeFi ecosystem,
where there are applications like Aave, where Ether is the primary pristine asset.
It is the Bitcoin of its respective ecosystem, right? And so like Aave, it has millions of
Ether in Aave, and people are accessing using Ether as collateral, as a store of value inside of Aave
to take on debt in stablecoins or other tokens on Ethereum in order to go be productive.
And so not only does Ethereum itself produce intrinsic yield because of the nature of how
Ether works, but Ethereum has its own DeFi ecosystem. It has its own on-chain Wall Street
that allows Ether to be productive. Are you going to use DeFi to get productivity?
Tell me about that strategy. Yeah. So I think as I alluded earlier,
we actually brought on a full-time head of DeFi who has been a core contributor to protocols
like Synthetix. So OG DeFi, in addition to having an institutional risk management background,
right? So he used to work in risk at JPMorgan, Fortress, groups like that, right? So it's
important to us. But I think one important thing to flag is that we are trying to create
an institutional quality vehicle, which kind of runs through everything we've done from day one.
And so when you look at this, you'll see us engaging in DeFi, but in a measured way,
you probably won't see us yoloing our whole stack into the latest protocol that dropped
over the weekend. What you're going to see is us helping to credentialize the battle-tested
blue-chip DeFi protocols that have functionally had a deck of billion-dollar bug bounties live
for years and prove their security over time. I think that's how you're going to see us engage
here and you will see us engage, right? I think to my knowledge, we're the only company of our
kind that has a dedicated full-time DeFi team, right? In-house as opposed to outsourcing some
of this. So for sure you will. Like I said, it'll be measured and they should be able to point to us
as proof to broader Wall Street that a given protocol is trusted and secure and is safe for
institutional adoption. And that's what's awesome about this, right? So we're going to,
I think you referenced Aave. I think Aave is a great example of something we would employ.
Over $50 billion of TBL, been around for five years, has had this bug bounty. It's not the
latest, greatest brand new thing that's yoloing 100% APYs. And this is where we're going to,
when we have our quarterly guidance calls with the public markets, we're going to be educating
what is DeFi and we're going to explain what is Aave and what is staking and what is restaking.
So half of this is the ability to explain what Ethereum is institutionally.
Use that word explain. Dave and I have often sat on bank lists since the very early days,
the most bullish thing for Ether is to be understood. And this has been part of the
challenge that we've seen, at least in traditional finance in Wall Street, that I was hopeful would
get better maybe post Ethereum ETF and it got marginally better, but it still is not there,
which is you talked about Citi being a banker in this and now we're going to see more sell side
type research and actual information about Ether the asset. I want you to tell the story, the
narrative of Ether the asset. So when you try to tell the story of Ether, not just Ethereum,
I feel like that Ethereum story has been told a lot of times by a lot of people, smart contract
platform, decentralized, global economy, all of these things. And then people are going, oh,
I love Ethereum, the technology. And sometimes in TradFi, they forget about Ether the asset,
or they think it's like an equity type of play. It's a high growth tech stock and they try to
value it based on revenue it throws off and all of these silly things. So what's your message to
Wall Street? When you describe Ether the asset itself, what is Ether? Ether is the commodity
to the future of the internet. Ether has multiple use cases and multiple ways to be valued.
Ether is the fuel for every computational step necessary to process a transaction
on the future of the internet. Ether generates yield intrinsically through staking, restaking,
and participation in the decentralized financial economy. And Ethereum has escape velocity
where 90% of the high quality liquid assets on blockchains are settled to Ethereum. And each
one of those requires a micro payment of Ether. EIP-1559 burns Ether on layer one transactions.
EIP-4844 essentially burns Ether through layer two blob transactions. So we have this burning
mechanism and the finite conversation versus a dynamic supply in our experience, that is a
feature and not a bug. And when we employ EIP-1559 for burning at layer one and EIP-4844 for blobs
that basically burn from layer two to layer one, we are working with a dynamic economy.
The world is way too sophisticated for something static like a finite supply.
So what are we dealing with here? Because in TradFi, they like to put things in categories.
You use the word commodity, which brings to mind things like oil, things even like a gold,
which has sort of been viewed as a monetary store of value type commodity. And of course,
Bitcoin has really taken off under the moniker of digital gold. What is Ether the asset,
if you're to categorize it? Because some in TradFi are still putting it in the,
oh, it's like Amazon stock or something, or it's like OpenAI stock or something like this.
It's a digital commodity. It's a CFTC accepted digital commodity.
Okay. Is it a reserve asset? Is it a store of value? Is it a currency?
It can be both. I mean, I think it can be all of the above.
Why should somebody put it on their treasury then? Is the reason because number goes up?
Is it number go up technology as well? I think if someone wants exposure
to how the future of the internet is going to work, the best beta on all of that
is the acquisition of Ether. How close is Wall Street to understanding
what you just said? What's kind of the Delta? And is that Delta the opportunity?
We're getting there. We're getting there. Give us four quarters of quarterly reporting
and education. And I welcome you all to join our quarterly guidance when we are a public company,
because that is our job. Our job, make no mistake, is to explain this to institutions.
What is Ethereum? What is Ether? What is staking? What is restaking? What is DeFi?
What are the blue chip best benevolent actors? What are the best use cases?
There is no Michael Saylor of Ethereum, because Ethereum and its use cases and its utility
should be the story. What's the size of this story?
So like, is this as big as gold? What's the size of the TAM of the internet?
I don't know. What is the size of the TAM of the internet?
We've been asked not to make specific price predictions, but I think both of us have published
extremely bullish price predictions in the past at orders of magnitude above where we are.
So you guys can't make price predictions. Is that yet? Because Michael Saylor makes
price predictions, let me tell you. The ETH Digital Oil piece, I helped co-author
with Tim Lowe and the good gentlemen and ladies at Etherealize, and we've pointed people to that.
I love the piece that ConsenSys recently released, both Dave and my alma mater,
on just showing the escape velocity and the gravitational pull of high-quality liquid assets,
where basically there's something like $250 billion of high-quality liquid assets on
blockchains, and over 90% of that's going onto Ethereum. And the best analogy I can make is
90% of searches happen on Google, and Yahoo gets 1%, and Bing gets 1%, and Ask Jeeves gets 1%.
And I'd ask you guys, when's the last time you've used Bing, Yahoo, or Ask Jeeves versus Google?
And I think that that is becoming more and more apparent, that Ethereum is the only blockchain
that is decentralized enough, has enough client differentiation to be a global substrate
where nation-states, institutions, and people can trustlessly interact with each other.
Is this a bigger story, a bigger opportunity than Bitcoin?
For sure. I mean, Bitcoin's TAM, if we want to be generous, is digital gold,
which is one use case, send, and one asset, Bitcoin. Ethereum can generate any asset
and can codify any function. So recently BlackRock filed a new S1 for their ETFs in order to make
staking happen inside of the ETFs. So let's assume, fast forward to the future, let's assume that
Ether ETFs are all staked ETFs, and so you can get the yield of Ethereum staking inside of the ETF.
Why in that world do we need the Ether machine then? Because then the ETFs are just doing it.
Great question. What I would point you to as a proxy are the European ETPs. If there's,
let's call it a billion euros in a European ETP, they are staking back of the napkin 50%.
So why aren't they staking at full capacity? And let's say the floor,
risk-free, just vanilla staking, is 3% yield. So on their billion euros in an ETP,
they're staking at 50% capacity, and so they're really earning approximately,
let's just use the example number of 3% yield, they're really only earning 1.5% on the total
amount of money. And the reason why is that the Ethereum protocol is built for decentralization,
and the brilliant researchers at the Ethereum Foundation don't really care about, you know,
what Trad 5 financial wrapper Ethereum can go in. They care about the scalability, robustness,
and decentralization of Ethereum. And to that point, there is a technological nuance
that is extremely important to understand. It's called the withdrawal queue. So today,
if one wanted to withdraw their Ether, it would happen in a few days. If, God forbid,
a bad black swan event happens on Earth, and the world goes risk-off, and everyone wanted to
unstake their Ether at the same time, let's call it 50% unstaking, 90% unstaking, that withdrawal
queue would go from a couple days to six months or a year. ETFs have 24-hour redemption requirements.
ETPs have 24-hour redemption requirements. So what we foresee, so what we're already seeing,
let's just call it right now, because we can, the ETFs have zero staking, but the ETPs are
staking at 50%. And they're only doing, let's call it floor vanilla staking. They're not able
to restake. They're not able to participate in DeFi. And we don't foresee a world where
the ETFs are going to be able to exceed a similar yield. And, you know, a devil's advocate would be,
well, what about a liquid staking token? If you guys have been watching, because we're the Ether
heads, and we've been, you know, able to understand the TradFi part, but we know Ethereum as well as
anybody else, the liquid staking token's de-pegged. So you think that BlackRock and Fidelity is going
to be able to use a liquid staking token that's just de-pegged? Nope. And furthermore, you know,
using this example, the billion euros staking 50% capacity only generating vanilla floor yield
versus our vehicle that doesn't have the 24-hour redemptions, that's able to participate in the
vanilla yield, that's able to participate in restaking, that's able to participate in DeFi.
That's why we believe this is the right vehicle for public market participants to access the
full suite of capabilities that Ethereum is able to generate. Maybe just to add on to that, right?
I think as you guys well know and have articulated over the years, ETH is a very dynamic asset,
more dynamic than some other ones that you might just sit on and hold that are appropriate for a
passive wrapper. Properly capitalizing on Ethereum requires active use and management
to maximally capitalize on that. That doesn't lend itself to a passive wrapper like an ETF.
It requires the kind of active management you can really only get in a company structure
if you're going to provide that in public markets. That's why we think this is the
best way for public market investors to own Ethereum over the medium to long term,
which is why we set this up with an eye towards the medium term with the de novo structure as
Andrew flagged. We're trying to set this up to become a pillar, not just of the Ethereum
ecosystem, but of Wall Street in the medium term. That's what we're doing here because this is the
way for those investors to own this asset. Yeah, that de novo structure, I think that
comes across in the ticker, right? Some of the other ETH treasury companies that we've seen,
they've been things with a B in them. That means they were formerly a Bitcoin mining type company
or other things that are not related to crypto at all, like gaming companies. That's where
SBET comes from. What's the ticker for the Ether machine? It's pretty clean, as I recall.
The ticker right now, because to your point, I looked at this from first principles and I thought,
well, if I want pure play exposure to Ethereum and to actively manage a vehicle to be able to
access the public equity and debt markets, I don't want to be operating or working on another
business that has pre-existing operations, pre-existing governance, pre-existing
liabilities. I wanted something clean. That's why we created a de novo entity, so a brand new LLC
that I anchored with my own capital because I'm going to lead by example and I'm not going to
let anyone do something that I wouldn't do myself and I'm patient zero and I need to be
maniacally focused on Ether accretion per share. That is the spirit of why we differentiated from
not doing a reverse takeover of some micro cap shell company.
The ticker currently is DYNX and will be transitioning upon SEC blessing of the merger
of the two businesses, DYNX and the Ether Reserve, once we create the Ether machine, will be ETHM.
ETHM. Right now on NASDAQ, this is trading under DYNX.
Let's call it three, four months. It's just like the SEC process where we then run our operating
business under the purview of the Ether machine, but currently it's DYNX, which is the blank check
company that we're merging with. Imagine a world where traditional finance meets the power of

Andrea, I gotta say, it's good to have your voice back in Ethereum. You're back in the spotlight,
and I think that maybe you could tell us a little bit about that because I think that a lot of
early Ethereum folks will remember your work at Consensus, will remember the Enterprise Ethereum
Alliance and some of those kind of early days and getting that off the ground. Maybe they just
assumed, you know, Andrew's passive. He's in the background now. I mean, maybe some people
assumed you were retired or that you were just like maybe no longer interested in Ether.
And then next up, we see you're launching a massive ETH treasury with a good chunk of your
own ETH stake. You're depositing this and now you're on CNBC. Did you ever leave? Why come back?
Why step back into the light? So a few reasons. So first and foremost, you're right. I went to
the first ever Ethereum meetup like a complete nerd in Manhattan, literally meetup.com, and was
with Aaron Wright, founder of the Lao, Joe Lubin, founder of Consensus, Sam Cassett, who is the chief
strategy officer of Consensus, like the OOGs of day zero pre-Ethereum, pre-Genesis block.
I ran around Asia with Vitalik explaining what is Ethereum to anybody who would listen.
2014, 2015, 2016, the first time Ether crossed one dollar, I put a permissioned version
of Ethereum onto Microsoft Azure and created blockchain as a service.
I helped create the enterprise Ethereum alliance, which was the largest open source standards body
focused on blockchain technology on earth. I helped build Consensus's global business
development, go to market strategy. I have been staking because I thought Ether was a commodity.
I created a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor named Dharma,
which is an acronym for digital asset risk management advisors, and have been securing
the Ethereum network from day zero of proof of stake. You may not have heard from me
during the Gensler era because there was no upside in speaking. But every minute of every day,
since proof of stake, I have been institutionally managing and securing the Ethereum network.
Now that we have a positive regulatory tailwind where we have acts like the Genius Act,
which basically gave stablecoin clarity, and the largest beneficiary of the Genius Act is Ethereum
because the majority of stablecoins settle to Ethereum. Now it's time to get loud again.
It's time to get this from proof of concept into production. The ZKEVM is en route. It's going to
improve speed, privacy, confidentiality. L2s are cooking really well. We're seeing the fast actors
like Coinbase with base, Robinhood with their L2, Kraken with Inc. creating their L2s that are all
going to settle to Ethereum layer one. All the institutions, both bracket banks, are going to
have their own L2. It's going to settle to Ethereum. We're here to usher that conversation
along and educate Wall Street top down, Main Street bottom up. Andrew, you mentioned something
that makes me want to go down a quick side quest about not wanting to be loud during the Gensler
administration. There's a debate in crypto world about how specifically the Gensler SEC
administration targeted Ethereum versus crypto broadly. They gave Bitcoin the green light and
then everything else they targeted. There's a debate as to whether or not Ethereum was
specifically hazed by the Gensler administration versus crypto broadly. There's one argument where,
no, the Gensler administration, they labeled Solana as security. They labeled other tokens
as security. They never specifically labeled Ethereum security, but they treated it as such.
Saying that the Gensler administration specifically targeted the ecosystem is just wrong because
literally they labeled Solana as security. That's one side of the debate. The other side of the
debate is, well, actually, they labeled Ethereum as security in secret and really pointed all their
firepower at the Ethereum ecosystem specifically. Ethereum builders like Danny Ryan specifically
got SEC subpoenas. Yes, while they targeted the crypto ecosystem broadly, it was Ethereum that
was really what was in the crosshairs of the Gensler administration. Provide your perspective
on that conversation for me. I believe that Ethereum got most of the headwinds
and Ethereum's position to get most of the tailwinds because, again, let's call it versus
Bitcoin. Bitcoin has one asset, Bitcoin on it, and one function, send, where Ethereum is going to
have infinite assets and infinite functionality. Ethereum is experiencing these parallel dynamics
similar to Google with Search where 90% of assets are being tokenized to settle on top of Ethereum.
Whether they specifically targeted Ethereum or not, what did they get right? They missed FTX,
they missed Celsius, but their real job is to... They emboldened meme coins. The majority of the
meme coins are on Solana. I think those are three strikes, you're out. If you're really talking
about protecting the US stakeholders, so I'd rather move forward. Hester Pierce is my hero
and let's keep moving forward. So, Andrew, you mentioned that you never left,
but at some level you're back in a loud way, okay? And you're back to tell the story of
Ether, the asset, and the entity of the Ether machine. The question is,
how loud are you actually going to be, okay? Michael Saylor's pretty damn loud. Are you
going to out loud, someone like that? And then second to that is, if we get how loud you're
going to be, I also want to know how are you going to be loud, okay? So, where are you going to go?
Most of crypto already knows about Ether, the asset. In order for the Ether machine to be
successful at some level, you have to take that to the rest of the world, take that to TradFi.
Sure. So, I'm going to let the use cases of Ethereum speak for themselves. I don't want
to be the Michael Saylor of Ethereum by any means. And I think Michael Saylor is amazing,
but the problem is, is he's got a singular asset that's got a singular function, and there's only
so much you can say about holding Bitcoin and sending it. With Ethereum, the good news is we can
talk about the productivity of the asset, the yield generation of the asset, the economy that's
being built on top of it, and we can make the Ethereum ecosystem the stars. So, where we're
going to differentiate is we're going to be highlighting the difference in that Ethereum
is a productive asset and a productive economy and letting the use cases speak for themselves.
And to where we're going to be having that conversation, you're right. You're not going
to necessarily see me at, even though you probably will see me because I love crypto events, but I
probably won't be best suited for the ecosystem there. I've got to go where people need to learn
about Ethereum, so there's probably going to be an institutional educational road show,
and then Main Street non-crypto, where we're educating people that are not as experienced,
but I love going to DevCon, I love going to ETHember, I love going to ECC in France,
and it's fun for me to see my friends and to see what's being built, so
you're not going to keep me away from the OG crypto conferences.
Let me just build on that a second. So, there's also a reason there's two of us on this podcast,
not just one, and you'll likely hear from more of the team in the future.
We're trying to build an institution, not a cult of personality, right? We want to build something
that is going to endure for the long term, like Ethereum itself, right? That's why the focus is
on the name, the Ether machine, right? We spend a lot of time on branding. We care about kind of
building a broad and deep institution here to drive the whole ecosystem forward, right? And
while Andrew is truly incredible and has a fascinating story, right? I think we hope to
highlight many more voices, not even just the two on this call. Yeah, totally. I think that's an
excellent point, and to that point, to kind of further elaborate, you're going to get probably
Ethereum and its use cases from me. You're going to probably get corporate strategy with respect
to Ethereum from Dave as a former McKinsey consultant who basically did corporate strategy
for some of the largest Fortune 500s on earth. You're going to get Ethereum and its staking
capabilities from Tim Lowe, who was the founder of Consensus' staking vehicle, built the institutional
staking vehicle for Dharma. You're going to get Ethereum and its DeFi capabilities from Darius
Pritchell, CFA, core contributor to Synthetix, core to Consensus' DeFi ecosystem. You're going
to get Ethereum and public company excellence from a new face on the block. His name is Jonathan
Cristodoro. He is a classic underachiever. Cornell, Wharton, Harvard, Marine Corps,
Morgan Stanley Investment Banking, worked for Steve Cohen, worked for Carl Icahn, sat on
a dozen corporate boards, including Xerox, Dell, Lyft, eBay, still sits on the board of PayPal.
Basically, he is going to be our lead on corporate governance and excellence because this is a public
company. We'll be explaining how Ethereum works in this context. We have another surprise
who's going to be joining us on growth and marketing, who's going to be marketing Ethereum
from Wall Street to Main Street, from The Hague to D.C., and basically explaining some of the
non-financial use cases. To Dave's point, the Ether machine story is going to be multifaceted
with multi-persona and multi-directional. But you're playing for number one slot here on this
board. Always play to win. Absolutely. Yeah. To build on it, I would say our real target is we
want to acquire as much of the network as we can without threatening the decentralization and
security of the network. Internally, we've actually been kicking around numbers of about 10%,
obviously. But our North Star here is really, over the medium term, to be clear, over the next five,
10 years, because to us, this is a long-term game. Like I said, our North Star is to acquire as much
as we can without threatening the network itself. Can I ask a question about that just in general,
so without threatening the network? This is the Bankless Podcast, right? Bankless means
self-custody of your own keys, defile of things. We're really excited to see the capital from
traditional finance enter the space. It's the world's largest capital market. It's only a matter of
time. Had to happen. We were going to integrate all of these things. But is there any worry
as we get a larger percentage of Ether inside of ETFs and inside of treasury companies that we lose
some of the decentralization in general? I mean, we're at low percentage points now, but you look
at the Bitcoin network, that's kind of where it's headed. No one's even transacting on Bitcoin
anymore. I mean, the fees are low because no one's doing it. People think they own Bitcoin
when they own like a micro strategy, and that's not the same as owning actual Bitcoin.
So is there a concern if we get too much in these treasury entities, too much in these ETFs that we
sort of lose some of the decentralization properties that made Ethereum and makes Ethereum what it is?
I don't think so, because I actually think that the transactional layer will be the layer twos,
and I think that Ethereum through its blob architecture, inspired by EIP 4844, really
encourages the application layer to be developed on thousands, potentially millions of layer twos
that are customizable. So I actually think that we will be good participants within the Ethereum
ecosystem, and we'll always have that North Star that this should be a decentralized, robust protocol,
and our contributions to it will never be in a place where it can harm the decentralization.
Yeah, and I think just to build on that, a large part of the value here, as Andrew alluded to,
is using Ethereum itself. So we aren't just a buy and hold structure. We're going to be using
the tokens to secure the network, to participate in the network.
We will be working to help grow the network. This isn't a passive-
The business model is ETH.
Exactly. And look, we think one of the most valuable aspects of Ethereum is its credible
neutrality, is its decentralization. That is, at the end of the day, core to the value prop here,
and obviously we won't do anything to undermine that in any way. But with that guardrail in place,
our aim is to get as big as we think we responsibly can.
Andrew, I'd love for you to weigh in on this, because you've been around Ethereum from the
very beginning. You've seen kind of the roadmap evolve. Back before, there was even the concept
of really proof of stake. It was in the distant future. Now it's here, obviously that happened
a while ago. David and I have been having this ongoing discussion where, looking at the price
performance of the past, I don't know, two to three years for Ethereum, it's pretty meager,
at least compared to what we think it can do. It's been lagging. Bitcoin, for instance,
Solana has had a good run, a couple of other altcoin ecosystems, but Ether has been kind of
flat. We're hanging out in the 3000s. My take on that is like, oh, it's because people don't
understand Ether, the asset. It's a narrative type problem. And that's why partially I'm excited
about Treasuries. David agrees with me. I think, David, you agree with me. But he also would add,
and I also agree with him, that, okay, a big problem too has been the roadmap itself and the
focus. And we did these layer twos, but we forgot to integrate them all together, right? So it feels
fragmented. We haven't economically integrated all of these things. And so maybe in the future,
and the EF hasn't shipped the way it should be shipping. I guess my question to you is like,
when you look at the Ethereum roadmap right now, 2025, what do you see? Are you bullish? Are you
optimistic? Do you still feel like we need some changes or pivots? So I think that there are
confluence of issues that I think have been ameliorated and we're seeing positive progress.
So first and foremost, I'll just group it. The Gensler era prevented the marketing of Ethereum.
People like me shut up. People like Consensus shut up. No one was going out screaming from the
mountains what Ethereum is, why it is what it is. And it also thwarted use cases. So we weren't able
to see Ethereum's capability where those headwinds have now turned to tailwinds, where the largest
beneficiary of the Genius Act is Ethereum because the majority of the stable coins happen on Ethereum.
So I think there's the political aspect. Then what I would say is super important
is the layer two architecture. So EIP 4844 dictated a lot around blob pricing and it's cheap.
It's super duper cheap. Coinbase owes the Ethereum Foundation a large donation, in my opinion,
because of how cheap base is and how much is settled to Ethereum layer one. But jokes aside
there, I think that that's the right architecture. And I would kind of analogize it to if you used
an Uber 10 years ago to go five miles, it cost X. And if you use the same Uber to go five miles,
it costs two, three X now. Basically, Uber became ubiquitous and became the majority of used
ride sharing app and has raised prices. And as the Ethereum layer one congestion increases
and more L2s anchor to Ethereum, I believe that we're going to see price per transaction,
gas burn, whether that's layer one and layer two evolve and frankly increase in price.
Third, the EF, I can't say that they haven't shipped like they should have because frankly,
they have a let's call it $400 billion network that's in flight and they've changed the engine
while in flight. Like proof of stake was amazing transition. And I have just welcomed all of the
evolution of the Ethereum foundation over the last six months. I am extremely bullish
on the direction they're going. It seems like realignment was necessary. And I think that
that happens within organizations. And it seems to me as though they have taken that initiative
very seriously. And I wouldn't have done this if I didn't think Ethereum is the only true
blockchain to be the substrate of the next generation of the internet.
Andrew, Dave, as we start to bring this to a close, I've got one thing in my mind. Every
cycle we've had in crypto, you guys have been through several of these seems to have a theme.
So last time for Ethereum, it felt like it was DeFi. DeFi just kind of broke out 2020.
And then we got NFTs after that 2021. There's some new use cases there. Looking for a theme
for this cycle that we're in, this bull cycle. And to me, it seems like what might be emerging
is the theme of institutional. It's the institutional theme. We saw Bitcoin take a
run just on the institutional bid, right? And it's up into the trillions of dollars. Now,
Ether is not in the trillions yet, but maybe it has the potential to get there. And I think it does.
Also, we're seeing real world assets. We're seeing the tokenization of stocks and treasuries. And
we've never seen that before. We're seeing stable coins. That seems like an institutional moment
where all of the banks are like, we need an Ethereum strategy, essentially. We need a
stable coin strategy. And so question in my mind, or maybe the bull case here, is like,
if this theme of this cycle is institution, what is the next institutional grade asset?
The first was Bitcoin, quite clearly. That's how it got into the trillions. Is the next Ether?
Or is it a long tail of all sorts of different assets? Am I onto something here? What do you
think the theme of the cycle is? Yeah, maybe I'll start there. Look, I think
we very much think the theme of this cycle is institutional adoption, right? That's why we're
doing this right now. And I think these concepts aren't necessarily novel. I believe Andrew was
first kicking around the idea of an ETH SPAC with some members of our team now in 2020.
But the reason for the push right now is because this is the vehicle for the moment. This is the
time of institutional adoption. And we're trying to drive that in a first-class way. And we're
seeing it not just in the rise of some of these vehicles like the Ether machine or like the ETFs,
but also in real adoption out of these banks. So when we are part of trying to build this
institutional quality vehicle is that we partner with a blue chip investment bank,
Bulls-Royce investment bank, to take this out. That had to get signed off at the very top of
that institution. We're the only treasury vehicle with that kind of support. And by the way,
they're only doing it in Ethereum, not other places, because they want to explore building
on Ethereum over the next year or two. So I think what we're seeing is it's taken some time to get
the wrappers up to allow Wall Street to own part of the Ethereum network, just as we have for years.
But the next step after that is going to be getting those use cases online, which I think
we're really going to start to see over the next 12 to 18 months. We only got regulatory clarity
out of DC in the last couple of weeks. And these large institutions can't build on Ethereum without
the regulatory clarity. They've only just gotten. And now they can actually start to
put into production some of the use cases we've been talking about for the better part of a decade.
Right. And so I actually think this institutional cycle is really just getting going.
And I'd add to that, you know, the bold brackets are starting to engage in DeFi.
They're taking a conservative approach. And one of the things they're looking for are clean blocks
that have no other transactions to any other unknown entities, including unknown validators.
They're also looking for a kind of timely inclusion of these blocks. And if they're
going to avoid the public block building marketplace, then the only option is a
direct agreement with a validator that has a decent proportion of the network.
We could be that validator. We are built to be that validator. So we will be working top down
institutionally and bottoms up for Main Street for the benefit of Ethereum and its
decentralization properties. I gotta say, Andrew, it's true that you never left, but I gotta say
it's great to have you back in the spotlight. I think I'm talking for, I'm speaking for a number
of people in the Ethereum ecosystem. It's just really great to have you back and doing what you're
doing in such an active way. And Dave, it's been great to meet you. What can folks expect to see
from the Ether machine next? The active acquisition and management
of Ether to compound Ether and to serve as a benevolent actor in the Ethereum community,
bottoms up Main Street, top down institution. We're here to help. When you say active
acquisition, does that mean spot order book purchasing of Ether with cash money?
That and OTC. Okay. Cool.
Amazing. Guys, we'll have to end it there. This has been an exciting episode. Dave,
Andrew, thank you so much for joining us today.
Thank you, guys. Bankless listener, gotta let you know, of course, you know crypto is risky.
You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is The Frontier. It's not for everyone,
but we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
