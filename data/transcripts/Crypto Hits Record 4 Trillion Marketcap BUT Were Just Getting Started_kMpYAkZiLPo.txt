Bankless Nation is the fourth week of July, the final week of July, it is time for the
Bankless Weekly Roll-Ups.
David, we got all-time high on the total crypto market cap, do you know that?
I just saw this while I was preparing the agenda.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 4.001 trillion dollars.
Yeah, yeah, that's great, for 4 trillion dollars, it's incredible.
Also, the Genius Bill was signed last Friday, the question is, what's next?
I think this is a big, big, big deal, and what do you do if you're the White House,
if you're Donald Trump?
Well, first, you got to throw a party with all the stablecoin bros, and he did that.
We have some clips from those shenanigans.
Also, the big question, what's going to happen next after the Genius Bill?
What next issuers are we going to see?
Yeah, what does this actually do?
What does this unlock?
How are the TradFi players going to make their moves after all this is unlocked?
Speaking of making moves, Polymarket is making moves into the United States.
They buy an onshore exchange that makes them U.S. compliant, we're going to talk about
that.
Shane Compline on CNBC, talking all about it, and then the big story of the week.
If you're on CT, this was the news of the week, was the ETH ETF inflows god candles.
The ETH treasury companies are soaking up ETH, but so are the ETFs.
The ETH ETF, ETH A, the BlackRock ETF, is now the third fastest ever ETF to hit one
billion dollars.
We're going to go look at a chart, and spoiler, it's just a vertical line, so we're going
to talk about that.
More ETH treasury companies got announced this week.
We're talking about that.
And lastly, an update.
Roman Storm's lawyers are asking for a mistrial after, will you believe this, the government
put up a witness who's stolen funds, probably didn't even use Tornado Cash, David.
What are they doing over there?
Witnesses that didn't use Tornado Cash?
What's the point?
All of this would be almost like hilarious if a man's life wasn't at stake.
So there's some big stakes here, and the Roman Storm trial will update you on all of that
and more.
I got to let you know, though, David is, he would be even higher energy given ETH price
point on the week, but my man's got a cold.
I'm a little sick.
I'm a little sick.
So if you're sounding that in the voice.
I'm here.
You're here and you're bullish, right?
I'm still, I'm here and I'm bullish.
That is correct.
Well, in your most bullish way, can you give us the Bitcoin price in the week?
Bitcoin price on the week up half a percent on the week.
We are currently clocking in at $119,000 Bitcoin, $119,000 Bitcoin.
No, no, no all time highs on the seven days, unfortunately.
Unfortunately.
How about ETH on the week?
No all time high yet either, right?
We still got 40% until the ETH all time high.
But nonetheless, a pretty happy week for ETH holders.
Nine point five percent.
We're going to round up to 10.
Yes, round up to 10 percent on the week.
So ETH up to $3,720 this week.
Pretty good week.
That's been a really good run.
David, I want to play this clip for you.
I just enjoy Jim Kramer sometimes.
Let me let me tell you what Jim Kramer says about Bitcoin.
Own something as a hedge against the 37, 8 trillion dollars.
They want to own a debt.
They want to own it for their kids.
And you know who else feels that way?
Me.
I don't want that debt.
My kids are worried about my kids.
Are you worried about your kids?
30 inch bill?
Yeah, we all do.
We all do.
So many different ways.
Why don't you buy some Bitcoin?
I just enjoy that exchange.
He's just like someone awkward.
He's just like turns to the other anchors.
He's like, you worried about your kids?
You worried about your kids with all that debt?
Why don't you buy some Bitcoin?
Why don't you buy some ETH?
I love how that's so simple.
It's just like, do it for the kids.
Do it for the kids.
Buy ETH for the kids.
Do it for your kids.
This is the hidden genius of Jim Kramer.
We've been talking about ultrasound money.
And this guy comes out and he's just like, buy.
Do it for the kids.
Yeah, showing ETH for the kids.
That's what we got to be doing.
How about the ratio on the week?
Are we greenish or?
Oh yeah, well, I mean, Bitcoin up half a percent on the week.
ETH are up 9.5% on the week.
So, you know, you add those, you do the math.
Not a math genius, but I think that means that the ETH BTC
ratio is up 9% on the week.
That's kind of how that works.
All right, and you said it in the intro,
but we are about above four trillion dollars, right?
We're actually slightly below it right now.
Okay, right now.
We're at four trillion.
We're rounding up to four trillion.
That's the highest.
That's the highest it's ever been, four trillion dollars.
The highest it's ever been has been this week.
That's correct.
And I guess our previous all-time high, what was that?
Was that in December?
That was December, 2024.
That was the previous total crypto market cap all-time high.
And then before that-
The launch of the Trump meme coin.
Yeah, before that we had 2021, 2.8 trillion dollars
was the top of the 2021 bull run.
Where do you think we go on the top here?
Six.
Six?
That is so bearish.
Six trillion.
That is bearish.
That is David Cold bearish.
I'm not going to accept that answer.
Six trillion, but I am a cold.
Do you want to ask me?
Ask me.
I don't think I do.
Let's move on.
10 trillion at least.
10 trillion this cycle in kind of like 18 months.
Yeah.
Or however long it takes.
I mean, could maybe it's six months.
I was on a TradFi content producer, Amit.
I was on a stream last night educating about ETH
because his audience was pretty large.
There were like almost 2000 people watching the stream.
He was like, all my listeners are asking about ETH.
And so I went on for an hour and talked about ETH.
And then of course they asked me,
he asked me the price predictions.
Don't tell me you gave him something stupid, like 7K.
I said 7K.
Oh my God.
By the end of this year.
By the end of the, I didn't say that was a top.
I said it was the end of year price prediction.
I said 7K.
Bank of Station, help me out here.
Let's get David a bit more bullish.
He's forgotten what ETH can do in a bull run,
in a secular bull run.
And maybe it's the cold speaking,
but I feel like you could pump those numbers up, buddy.
In addition to that, I also talked about the F word.
Because not in the near term,
he asked, do you think ether will ever F word Bitcoin?
And I didn't give a timeframe on that
because I've been burned by that in the past.
I don't wanna be,
I don't wanna give out that level of specificity.
But I said, the Ethereum is shooting
for the number one spot.
And it's doing it with all of the research
and all the innovation and all the investment
that the Ethereum Foundation has put into Ethereum.
So the purpose of Ethereum
is to become the number one spot.
And it's got the chops to do it.
And time is on Ethereum's side.
Bitcoin actually does not have time
because time actually decays Bitcoin.
It actually like falls apart every time
with quantum and the security budget.
But Ethereum has time on its side.
And so I gave my bullish,
yes, eventually, ETH takes the number one spot take.
Well, further into this episode,
I'm actually going to invoke the F word,
but not quite yet, okay?
And we'll put that into context.
First, you gotta tell me about some of these coins
pumping on the week.
Yeah, we got some movers of the week.
Athena, the big mover of the week.
It's definitely downstream of the Athena Treasury Company
that went live.
There's a little nuances on that one
because I don't know if it's specifically stacking
ENA, the token.
They are a little bit, right?
But for buyback to kind of stabilize things,
it's a thing, right?
It's a thing.
So Athena pumped 28% in the week.
Pengu, the meme coin of the Pushee Penguins ecosystem
pumps 25%.
That price action is incredible.
It's a very large green candle.
And then Uniswap.
Not often do you see Uniswap as a mover of the week,
but up 13% on the week.
Why?
Do they add a fee switch?
God, I wish.
Could you imagine?
Why isn't the Uniswap in the year of our Lord 2025?
Why is the fee switch not on?
Dow, help us out.
Dow, where's the Dow?
Somebody just, paradigm.
Andreessen, just turn it on.
Yeah, it's time.
I don't, you know.
I'm still holding this goddamn back year.
Well, some good news for your altcoin bags as well.
Google searches for altcoins just hit a four year high
according to Lark Davis.
So you got that going for us in Google search.
Does anyone use Google anymore though?
I wanna see some chat GPT numbers.
That's what I wanna see.
Yeah, when Google, the altcoin term is in Google
at an all time high.
I'm like, that doesn't make me feel great.
Yeah, who searches for altcoins?
I feel like only crypto native people do that.
Yeah, I don't know.
I bet you if you typed in the XRP search term for Google,
it would be also very high.
I don't wanna do that, David.
I don't wanna do that.
I can't look at the XRP price on the week anymore.
It hurts too bad.
There's just an XRP bull market
and we're just living in it.
Yeah, it's pretty much true.
Some numbers I can look at on a weekly basis
and I will look at this week are the ETH ETF flows.
You mentioned that God candle in ETH ETF flows
and you were not lying.
Not that they have candles.
If they did, it would be God's test.
No, I got a candle here.
I got a candle in the agenda.
Yeah, we can see candles.
Okay, so this is Matt Hogan and this stat for you.
So between July, 2024 and now ETH inflows,
we're about $4.2 billion.
An entire last year, $4.2 billion.
Just in this month, July, 2025, we exceeded that amount.
That's so stupid.
That's a God candle.
Oh my God.
A week now?
Okay, so let me show it to you.
Well, this is kind of how it looks
on the Eric Balchunis charts.
That's the vertical chart that I was talking about.
Yeah, this is ETH in green.
What's interesting here is so I bit in orange, all right?
So this is Bitcoin.
This is just the BlackRock, ETH-A numbers,
which is like 80% of all inflows into Ethereum.
It's got the dominant position of BlackRock as well.
You can see, what did Bitcoin ETFs do?
They went vertical pretty much from day one.
They were just shot right up like a SpaceX rocket, right?
Not coming down.
And what about Ethereum?
Ether ETFs were slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
It's been slow over the last year.
It's kind of up and down, up and down.
And then suddenly this month.
It goes from like five billion in ETH-A deposits
to 10 billion in like four days.
It's doing what the Bitcoin chart is doing
just with like a one-year delay, at least so far.
I mean, that's pretty impressive, right?
And we also got a, this is where I'm gonna use that for it.
We got a flippening, okay, in daily inflows.
So for the last five days, Ethereum ETF daily inflows
have exceeded Bitcoin daily inflows
by like a whole lot, every single day.
A whole lot, yeah.
So that happened as well.
Yeah, so the total ETF rankings,
Bitcoin $54 billion in Bitcoin ETFs.
ETH coming in at $8.7 billion in ETF deposits.
And since Solana's on there, technically it has an ETF,
105 million in Solana ETF deposits.
That's the current ranking, the current horse race.
I mean, it does seem that if ETH just even catches up
to its market cap size in proportion to Bitcoin,
it's got some growing to do, right?
That's what, at least like 15 billion or so,
something like that.
And then maybe it exceeds that.
So we'll have to see.
Some more institutional purchasing of ETH on the week
was this, David.
We've got another ETH treasury company
that is- This website is so aesthetic.
Yeah, it's called the Ethereum machine.
No, sorry, the Ether machine,
because it's all about ETH asset.
And what's this?
Who's behind it?
How much are we talking?
Yeah, this is a good friend, Andrew Keys.
We had him on the podcast so long ago,
and we're gonna record with him tomorrow on Friday.
That little episode will be out on Monday.
That episode will add roughly $10 to $50 billion
onto its market cap.
Looking forward to that one.
So it's all about Ether, the productive asset.
This is also something, Ryan,
since you called me an ETH bear a second ago,
this is also something I talked about
on the stream last night.
Again, with the kind of like Trad 5 retail audience.
Ether, the asset, has a particularly strong resonance
with crypto acquisition companies in comparison to Bitcoin,
simply because Bitcoin is inert.
It's just an inert asset.
And that's its narrative, 21 million hard cap units.
That's how it works.
But ETH is productive.
And so when these ETH acquisition companies come online
and they take on debt,
they take on debt that have to pay off
like two to four to 5% in order to take on a debt.
That's their debt payments.
Well, they can pay that off
using the yield that they get
from the Ether that they purchase.
And so there is this automatic repayment mechanism
that Ether, the asset, specifically enables
for his acquisition companies.
And this is exactly the narrative that Andrew Keyes
is leaning into with the Ether machine.
He wants to make Ether,
the Ether that the Ether machine acquires,
as productive as possible
in order to scale out how much access to debt,
access to credit that he can finance.
And he's leveraging that.
And so like literally the number one thing
that they say on the website,
we exist to make Ether productive.
And the best part about this is that he's,
there's seven different ways to make Ether productive.
And one of the biggest ones is that
he's just gonna take Ether
and he's gonna inject it into DeFi.
He's gonna go get yield on Aave.
He's gonna go stake it on Ethereum.
Whatever ways in DeFi that Ether can become productive,
he will use.
And I think like companies like this
that are doing DeFi operations to get yield on their Ether,
they're just gonna inject a whole bunch of TVL
onto Ethereum DeFi,
which is just gonna give the whole ecosystem a boost.
So there's a really just sexy flywheel going on here
between Ether, the asset, being productive,
putting it into DeFi,
and then having that go onto Wall Street,
having Andrew Keyes go onto Wall Street,
and then pitch this operation
that he's doing to the boomers.
So they can FOMO in to our backs.
It's gonna be great.
Yeah, he was on Wall Street too.
Do you see him on CNBC?
They asked him, okay,
after he gave kind of somewhere pitch that you just gave,
basically they said,
so Andrew, do you own any Bitcoin?
This was his response.
So you're an Ethereum guy, do you own Bitcoin?
I'm not, I do not own Bitcoin.
None.
I'd rather have an iPhone than a landline.
Ooh.
Wow.
Did you see what Andrew said after that?
No, I heard him say it.
He went, ooh.
So right after that, he goes-
Burn, sick burn.
I think that's what the kids call a sick burn.
Oh, you said that?
Oh my God, that's so funny.
Okay.
Yeah, so it's Andrew Keyes there,
just talking about the apps and the economy
that you can build on top of this productive asset
called ETH.
So a few other stats.
This was to be the largest ETH treasury to date.
Was to be?
Was to be?
Well, I got an update for you.
Okay, so it was to be 400,000 ETH.
That would be top of the charts.
Last I saw the ETH reserve,
last we were looking at it last week,
Lubin and Tom Lee,
they were having around 300,000 ETH in terms of supply.
This would be 400,000 from Andrew Keyes.
So they're coming in,
jumping in at the number one spot,
but you said-
That was the plan.
That was the plan.
Yeah, everybody's got a plan
until Tom Lee enters and buys some more ETH.
Okay, but first of all,
I gotta tell you what the ticker is,
and it's a nice clean ticker.
It's ETHM, E-T-H-M, all right?
So it's not a former Bitcoin mining thing.
It's not a sports thing.
It's just straight ETHM, which I sort of like.
I think that matters, actually.
No, really?
Versus Sharp Link Gaming.
Granted, Joseph Lubin has done a great job,
because whenever I-
Strategic bet on ETH, yeah.
When I think SBET, I think strategic bet on ETH, yeah.
But then Tom Lee's bit mine.
I think the branding actually matters here.
Yeah, a little bit, maybe.
I don't know, who knows?
You know what does matter, though,
is when you buy in size,
and that's what Tom Lee did.
So breaking, as of today,
this is the time of recording,
Bitmine Immersion, BMNR,
added another 266,000 ETH to its balance sheet,
bringing its total, you ready for this?
New number one slot,
566,000 ETH on the balance sheet.
That's number one?
That's number one, by a healthy margin here, okay?
That's two billion.
And if I were to run some math for you,
remember we got into just a little bit
of the math last week, right?
Tom Lee said he wants to buy 5% of all ETH.
We're about one month in to the Tom Lee purchase engine.
He's 10% of the way there.
He's got another 90% of the way to go,
if he's gonna hit that 5%.
Right now, Michael Saylor owns 2.9% of Bitcoin.
So Tom Lee is planning to almost two sailors worth of ETH
in proportion to Bitcoin,
in proportion to the amount that MicroStrategy owns.
And he's not gonna be able to always buy it
at these prices, is he?
I mean, if he doesn't-
You gotta get it below the all-time high.
He got it, he gotta do that.
I mean, that's pretty, like you were talking about,
last time you were talking, you were talking about,
oh, it's gotta be the race to a billion ETH,
or sorry, a million ETH, right?
Million ETH.
We're 50% of the way there on that race too.
We're just like a month or two in.
You know what?
New race, 10 million ETH.
New race, 10 million ETH.
BitMind is 5% of the way there.
Keep going, Tom Lee, you're doing great.
I think they'll get diminishing returns.
It gets harder and harder to buy with fiat
as the price goes up, right?
I mean- 10, 10-
And you're in your heady 7K levels, oh my God.
But wake me up at 10 million ETH.
The BitMind immersion technology's up 10%,
that was announced today, right?
The acquisition that you were just talking about?
Yeah, just this morning, on Thursday for-
On Thursday, which is today, yeah.
9.5% BitMind technology, no, yes.
That's what the stock price jumped today.
Yeah, and you know what?
When Tom Lee is schmoozing with people like Kathie Lee,
who's also purchasing BitMind,
and this guy, you recognize this guy?
Yeah, that's Jason, that's Jensen from NVIDIA.
Dude, Tom Lee's such a funny looking guy, man.
That's part of the appeal, man.
Just the hair is working for him, you know, he's just-
Yeah, something's doing it for me.
Yeah, you like this?
I'm into it.
All right, you ready to revise your price predictions now?
Okay, so I am a holder of SBET, Ryan, I don't know if you are.
I'm a holder of SBET, and SBET is down 40% on the week
after it peaked out at $40,
and I know that Joseph Lubin is just dumping on me
because he's gonna issue shares to raise funds
to go buy more ETH, and it's like a mixed feeling
that I have of just like, okay, so I'm holding the stock,
and I'm adding to the premium,
and Joseph Lubin's gonna sell this,
and he's able to sell it because people like me are buying,
but he's dumping on me, but it's okay
because he's gonna go buy more Ether,
and then when he announces it, it's gonna go back up.
It's just like a weird, weird-
I got the perfect solution for you.
You ready for this?
Okay, make sure you just still own some ETH, man,
and he's dumping on you in order to buy your other bank.
My other bank.
Cannot fail.
Actually, comes the question.
These are some questions from the Bankless Nation
that our private Discord for Bankless Citizens,
they've been asking about the treasury.
I wanna raise some of these questions
because when somebody starts saying things like cannot fail,
that was satire, by the way, okay?
Don't clip me, clip lords.
At some point, this is going to go
in a direction where it's over-pumped,
and that was the first question
that came out of Bankless Discord.
Is the hype around ETH treasury plays
indicative of a bubble?
What do you think, David?
Um, a bubble seems like such a binary thing.
So is it a bubble or not?
Like, it's bubble-ish, it's definitely frothy.
It's definitely like, you know,
the euthanasia rollercoaster.
Like, we have one good thing,
and then, like, crypto has a pattern
of taking one thing to its logical conclusion,
which is incredibly distorted.
I definitely see that that's what's happening.
Litecoin, treasury acquisition companies,
like, come on, like, let's be clear.
Yeah, come on, you're not a buyer.
Yeah, and so, like, this is a message
that I sent inside of our Bankless team Discord,
just kind of, like, about my thoughts on it,
just to, like, kind of give everyone a heads-up
of where I am with this meta, this bubbling meta.
Like, at the end of the day, yes, this is a true unlock.
Like, treasury vehicles are a net new thing,
both for TradFi and crypto.
There's a real primitive here that is valuable
that Michael Saylor has pioneered,
and now we are trying to copy.
And so, I don't want to discount that.
When we look at some of the deals
of the ETH treasury companies
or the Bitcoin treasury companies,
they are pulling forward demand.
And so, we are borrowing from the future
to have demand today.
So, it's kind of a shot in the arm.
It's a little bit of a shot in the arm.
And in the process, reflexively creating net new demand
that you wouldn't otherwise have.
Definitely that, and that is both,
you know, there's a double-edged sword,
so we're reflexively, you know, causing marketing to happen.
You know, the price is the best marketing,
so we're buying it, we're bringing in net new buyers
via that shot in the arm.
And you know, maybe that shot in the arm
is especially what Ether needed
to get it out of its REV meta from the ETH concerners
and into the ETH as a global reserve asset meta
that the ETH treasury companies are taking it.
So, maybe we're elevating Ether into a better market.
It needed to happen.
It needed to happen.
We're not even at all-time high yet, right?
Yeah, and so, that's kind of how I'm thinking about this.
It's a one-time shot in the arm
that we don't know how large that shot in the arm is.
Maybe it's very large.
Like, maybe like this race for crypto reserve assets
is very large and maybe it keeps on going.
This is something that, here's my cautionary tale,
is that there is opportunity for grift
in these treasury companies.
It doesn't matter if it's a Bitcoin treasury company,
an ETH treasury company, a Litecoin treasury company,
but I think as you go down the market cap,
the likelihood of it being pretty grifty goes up
or the surface area for grift goes up.
And I'm gonna harken back to the days
of the yield companies, Celsius, BlockFi, Gemini Earn,
which no one really wants to be lumped in with Celsius,
but Celsius was cheating.
It was a Ponzi scheme that was cheating
and it was truly grifty.
And Celsius was so bad that they pulled in their competitors
to kind of get into the mud with them.
And so BlockFi really, in order to be competitive,
had to do some things it didn't really want to do
and that got Zach Prince in trouble with BlockFi.
But like, were they really bad to begin with?
Not really.
And then there's Gemini Earn who was involved with
just in the yield arena,
but they didn't lose any customer funds
at the end of the day.
And so these are the same three businesses.
One was a full out scam.
One was above board, but kind of got sucked into the mud.
And then one was totally fine,
but it was just in the same environment.
And it's really about the leadership, in my opinion.
It's gonna be the leadership of these respective
ETH treasury companies or crypto treasury companies
that determines whether this thing is
the final outcome of each individual company.
That's kind of my analysis on these things.
Yeah, my take is, I see that analogy for sure
in terms of things that go out of hand,
have gotten out of hand.
But just to be clear, this is nothing like Celsius.
You know what I mean?
There are assets there.
What you really have to worry about is the MNAV premium
on all of these treasuries.
And there could come a time
where that actually dips below one.
And that would cause some unwind.
And you don't know who's making bets and leverage
and things in the background.
We didn't know that Three Hours Capital
was doing all this shit in the background
on top of the GPTC, like NAV plays, right?
And so you don't know until you get into bearish territory
and that could unwind in a hurry and cause some chaos.
I guess my take around bubble territory is,
I'm yellow, all right?
It's not green.
It's not red yet.
It's not red, yeah.
It's not even orange.
It's yellow moving to orange.
What I do think that could happen
is an after boom into ether though.
You were talking about the, I'm sorry, into DeFi rather.
You were talking about the productive capital uses, all right?
This is Hugh Carp, Nexus Mutual.
ETH treasury companies reaching out as they plan to deploy
into ETH staking DeFi and want to do it safely.
Pretty bullish for DeFi generally.
I think that's something to get ahead of,
but I think all of that will happen.
Like we'll see DeFi do a run
before this whole thing is over.
So I still feel like we've quote unquote got some time,
but you can see things are moving that direction
a little bit more.
How in the world did Bitmine and Tom Lee
just stack another, what, 250,000 worth of ETH?
Another billion dollars, a cool billion dollars
without moving the market.
You said we're up 9% on the week.
I mean, shouldn't we be up like 29% on the week
with these kinds of purchases?
Which sort of makes you wonder like
what the source of this actually is.
Is this OTC going in the background?
This is some speculation here.
Did Justin Sun sells ETH stack to Bitmine OTC, right?
Justin Sun did some unwinding this week.
I don't think that's necessarily the case,
but I guess-
I can totally believe it.
It is interesting, right?
There's some stuff going on behind the scenes, OTC sales.
There are some net sellers of ETH
or else you wouldn't have Tom Lee being able to purchase
a billion worth of ETH
without this massively affecting prices.
It's only affected prices a little bit.
So that's also interesting as well.
Yeah, well, eliminating sell pressure
is the same thing as adding buy pressure.
Esbet absorbed however much the Ethereum Foundation
just sold to them.
So yeah, we didn't get Esbet buying ETH
because they bought it from the Ethereum Foundation
who would have otherwise sold it.
So in the Grinch scheme of things,
it actually nets out equivalently.
Like Justin Sun, if Justin Sun unwound his ETH
and gave it to Tom Lee,
Justin Sun was eventually going to sell that ETH
for one reason or another, and now he's not
because now it's in a ETH Treasury Acquisition Company
and his goal is to hoard as much ETH as possible.
So I feel better about Tom Lee having Justin Sun's ETH
than Justin Sun having Justin Sun's ETH.
Hypothetically, all of that's a rumor.
I don't even, it's probably not the case,
but substitute Justin Sun for some other OTC seller
and you get kind of a similar outcome.
But buyer beware on these Treasury entities.
Some more news that maybe the end is getting a little closer.
This is Solana Bull, Joe McCann.
He just launched a liquid fund.
Oh, sorry, he just launched a Solana Treasury.
1.5 billion is what he plans to raise.
So notable hedge fund manager, Joe McCann.
Notable, definitely notable this week.
Certainly notable.
Certainly notable.
David, we got a lot more to talk about,
including the Trump party, the crypto party
at the White House as genius became law.
Trump also met with Palo, the founder of Tether.
It's got to be the first time.
That was a fun encounter.
Also, Polymarket, now available in the US.
We'll talk about how that is.
And a little bit later, you're going to tell us
how Ethereum is shipping bigger blocks without a hard fork.
How do we make that happen?
But before we get to all of that,
we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible,
including our friends over at Uniswap,
is the best place to do DeFi.
They've got a mobile wallet.
They've got a browser wallet.
Of course, they have an exchange.
Go check them out.
Ethereum's layer two universe is exploding with choices.
But if you're looking for the best place to park
and move your tokens, make your next stop Unichain.
First, liquidity.
Unichain hosts the most liquid Uniswap V4 deployment
on any layer two, giving you deeper pools
for flagship pairs like ETH USDC.
More liquidity means better prices, less slippage,
and smoother swaps, exactly what traders crave.
The numbers back it up.
Unichain leads all layer twos in total value locked
for Uniswap V4.
And it's not just deep, it's fast and fully transparent,
purpose-built to be the home base
for DeFi and cross-chain liquidity.
When it comes to costs, Unichain is a no-brainer.

Last Friday, the genius bill was signed into law.
This is a bunch of guys,
bunch of members of Congress, I should say, watching.
And a few Bankless podcast guests.
Yeah, I see a few here.
A call member, yeah.
Bill Haggerty.
Oh yeah, there's Bill, good old Bill.
There's something funny about just eight dudes
surrounding Trump, looking over his shoulder
while he signs a bill, yeah.
Oh, that was it.
So genius bill signed into law, of course.
So last Thursday, the House approved genius.
It was a 308 to 122 vote.
Great ornate said yes, not even close, man.
That is the, wow, blowout.
And after it was signed,
they had a party at the White House.
They called it a ceremony
with a whole bunch of the stable coin folks.
Actually, maybe I'll play some clips.
This is sort of a clip reaction
with some of the names who attended there.
My name is Michael Mebucha.
I'm the CEO at MasterCard
and we just witnessed the signing of the genius bill.
This is really the beginning
of a financial revolution here in America.
With the passing of this, we've got crypto stable coins now
that can be built right here in America
to make every payment fast, cheap, and more global.
Enables us to upgrade the financial system,
make it fairer, more accessible.
The president was able to achieve
one of the most important changes
in the legal framework in the United States
to allow the creation and the safely usage of stable coins.
This is gonna meet fantastic benefits
for individuals and businesses around them.
Looking forward to the great results
for crypto and for the US.
This is a great day for crypto.
This is a great day for the US dollar.
And it's a great day for America.
This is foundational legislation,
foundational regulation that is gonna unlock
the power of the internet
in rebuilding the financial system.
Not only that, but it positions the US
as the global leader in this new digital assets industry,
which I think is incredibly important.
So they just posted a glazed video
out of the White House main account.
Yeah, that was out of the White House Twitter account.
Wow.
Okay, that's pretty incredible.
And Trump, I get the sense that this is the actual,
the first time maybe Donald Trump met Palo from Tether,
but he called him out by name as part of the ceremony.
Here he is.
Palo, Ardino of Tether.
Palo, Palo, thank you Palo.
How far has Tether come on his journey?
Yeah, look at Donald Trump shaking hands with Palo here
and you get the sense that, wow,
I wonder if Palo just whispered to him,
do you know how many treasuries I own?
Tether has more treasuries
than the majority of G20 countries.
Do you think Palo is like Trump, I'm your daddy?
I'm not quite at that level.
Not very many people have leverage over Trump
because he's just like a big figure,
but Palo, Palo's got leverage.
It's kind of crazy that an individual
of a corporate interest has that amount of treasuries.
Hi, I own $160 billion of treasuries.
You better be nice.
This is Scott Bessent talking about the genius bill.
Of course, the treasury secretary,
blockchain technologies will power the next generation
of payments and the US dollar is coming on chain.
Thanks to President Trump's leadership,
we got the genius act,
which will help cement the US dollar
as the global reserve currency for generations to come.
That's really the message.
There's a win-win for the US here and also for crypto.
We get the dollar as the reserve currency
for generations to come.
My family members actually brought this up to me.
They're like, oh, genius bill signed.
What do you think?
So I think this has gotten some mainstream attention.
Not a lot, you don't get a lot of bills.
Okay, so you have three kids and a wife.
Which family member?
Oh, no, no, extended family members.
It was actually my father-in-law and he mentioned it.
He never talks to me about crypto and he's like,
oh, genius bill passed, tell me about that.
So I told him about it.
Whoa, your family members are asking you
about the genius bill,
they're not asking you about like XRP or Cardano?
Oh, no, other family members are doing that.
That's like the text messages you get like after 10 p.m.
All right.
What I'm saying is it's pretty notable.
It's national news.
When Congress passes a bill with bipartisan support,
that's national news and they did it on crypto.
There's also, we're talking about what Tether's plans are
now that this bill has been signed.
So when we had Paulo on the podcast,
we asked him a little bit about this.
And he wasn't, I'm not gonna call him cagey,
but he's being patient with the Tether plans
post the genius bill.
I don't think he's in any rush.
And the reason why he's not in any rush
is because Tether has three years to comply
with the genius bill.
And there's two different ways to comply
as I understand it, Ryan.
Maybe you can fact check me.
But there is becoming a,
there's being a foreign issuer,
which Tether is going to be.
So they're going to comply as a foreign issuer.
With the existing USDT, right?
With the existing.
They might go down that path.
Yes, the foreign, the current USDT,
as we all know it and use it,
is going to register as a foreign issuer.
And then Tether is going to spin up a US centric coin,
a new token that's going to comply
with the onshore compliance.
And why he's going to spin up a second coin
rather than just like make Tether onshore.
I'm not sure if we totally know one of the reasons.
I think he wants to keep his options open,
quite honestly, you know?
You have the domestic one.
It might not make sense for USDT to fully register, actually.
Which would mean it would be effectively banned
from US exchanges.
But he might be fine with that.
That actually might be the net EV play.
Is Tether on Coinbase anyways?
I mean, a little bit, right?
But like not in size, not in size.
And it's almost, you kind of wonder
if it's actually a bug for USDT
to be like formerly registered,
recognized by the United States.
Maybe the holders of Tether don't fully want that.
Maybe that's more of a bug than a feature for them.
So maybe he's just playing his options here.
Yeah.
But it does mean that in order to be a foreign issuer,
he's going to have to move away from Bitcoin, gold,
and corporate bonds backing Tether.
And this is the existing Tether.
And so he has to move all the reserves
towards T-bills and cash-like instruments.
Yeah, he might not want to do that either, right?
But he already bought the Bitcoin
at like $20,000 Bitcoin.
He's already bought gold at like 40% cheaper
than current prices.
So he's already in a huge profit.
So I don't think he's too bummed about that.
You know, one of the other things I like about this is,
people outside of crypto, they say things like,
oh, crypto has no use cases.
I mean, look at it.
It's just, and they ignore it completely,
store value, Bitcoin number go up
because that's just Ponzi tech.
So they ignore that and they're like,
it has no use cases.
Stablecoins are an incredible use case.
This is easily a 10 to 20X better system than,
like I was trying to do a wire last week
from one bank to another, one of my banks to another.
My God, it took days.
At one point, the wire, yeah, it took days.
I don't know how many people I talked to
on the phone to do this.
Literally at one point, the wire got lost.
It's absurd.
It got lost.
The notion of getting a wire loss is insanity.
I really don't understand how wires work,
but I very clearly,
I know when I move USDC or stablecoin
from one address to another,
I could see the settlement on chain
and it happens instantly, 24 hours a day.
It's easy.
We don't need a whole back office,
multiple phone calls to all these people
to actually move funds around.
This is a 10X improvement already.
And that's just moving funds domestically.
You're trying to get funds to somewhere else in the world.
It's like impossible.
Like the banking system kind of sucks.
I mean, this is the reason we started this podcast,
but it's actually true.
It does suck.
And stablecoins are a 10X improvement, at least on that.
Whenever I hire a guide,
guides are always a pain in the butt to send money to.
A mountain guide.
Mountain guide, yeah.
To climb.
So it's always in a foreign country.
It's usually in Europe or Argentina or something.
Sending the money is a huge pain in the ass.
And I don't really want to be like the crypto guide
before I meet them,
but then I go hang out with them
for like three days in a row
and you have to talk to them about your life
because you're spending three days with them.
So they ask me what I do
and I talk about crypto.
And so I just teach about them crypto
because they're stuck with me for three days.
But then I always say,
okay, I'm going to tip you with crypto.
You always tip your guide.
But I get them to download Coinbase or Kraken
or whatever continent they're in.
And then I get them to send me their Tether address.
And then I send them Tether and they're like,
whoa, that was instant.
And like, I didn't even have to give you any information
and like all that stuff.
This is great.
Yeah.
And I think I pill them every single time
about at least accepting crypto as an option for payments.
Stablecoins are great for payments.
They sure are.
Polymarket, David, is now available,
going to be soon available to US users
for the very first time.
That's sick.
So I don't have to use a VPN.
This is Shane Coplin basically saying,
this pays the way for us to welcome American traders again.
I've waited a long time to say this.
Polymarket is coming home.
David, how is he doing this?
How is Polymarket coming home?
Yeah, so they just acquired an exchange.
So they acquired Skew CEX,
which had just received its CFTC license
just weeks before the deal.
And so this other company gets the CFTC license
and then Polymarket buys it.
And that was probably,
the deal was probably in the works prior to that.
And so they basically bought the registration.
And so now that they're using that exchange,
they now have the compliance that they need
to get to US customers.
When this goes live, uncertain,
I'm assuming it's not happening like immediately.
No, it's not.
But soon TM?
You got to join a wait list in order to do this.
So there's a place you can join in the US on a wait list
and they'll notify you when it's ready.
But yeah, this is a CFTC approved.
Actually, Shane went on CNBC and explained this to-
Dude, each people on CNBC.
We've just like dominated CNBC conversations
over the last two weeks.
Let's hear him.
You've been operating.
We talk about Polymarket as if everybody can use it,
but the truth is that most folks couldn't
because you had to be out, you had to be in Europe.
For trading.
I mean, I think the way you guys talk about Polymarket
it's kind of like become the Bloomberg terminal
for reality almost.
And it's awesome.
I'm humbled that every time I tune into Squawk Box,
you're like, well, Polymarket.
And I was watching Eric Adams episode
and the first thing he said is like,
well, the Polymarket for this.
And I was just like, I'm from New York.
I went to high school right here.
And the mayor talking about our site
is just incredible.
But yeah, I mean, look, there's a ton of latent demand
for people who want to participate in the markets,
not just look at it.
So for us, where we sit, it was like a must have.
And so what happens now?
So obviously I think people were pretty surprised.
It was like a big acquisition.
And the simple way to put it is it's kind
of the perfect asset.
So it's an exchange and a clearinghouse.
And that lets us go and serve brokerages and FCMs,
as well as retail and institutions,
which is really important.
They all know and love Polymarket.
When I get to meet these people, they say,
oh my God, Polymarket's amazing,
but I wish we could trade on Polymarket.
And ask and you shall receive, right?
So how much does this compete?
It's pretty great.
I mean, his whole story arc-
That's bullish.
Yeah, Shane's story arc.
Like a year ago, he was being investigated by the FBI.
I mean, they busted into his house.
Now a year later, he's on CNBC announcing an acquisition,
coming home to the United States.
I feel like this type of thing also,
if I were to put my money long-term,
maybe there's a Polymarket for this.
Is Polymarket going to go public?
Doing this kind of CNBC road show tour
is part of the way you kind of build an audience for that.
I don't know what's in Shane's mind.
We haven't talked to him about this,
but that could actually be a possibility
for Polymarket to go public.
I mean, this is an entrepreneur
with some pretty big ambitions, I would say.
Yeah, I'm sure Shane has some PTSD from getting raided.
And as a founder, I think being a public company
on the public stock market is like raid insurance.
Like the next administration that comes in,
you can't raid the founder of a public company.
Like that's ridiculous.
You're exactly right.
Or somebody that's on CNBC, mainstream media all the time.
In fact, actually, Andrew asked him that question
about him getting raided.
This is what he said.
Did you freak out that morning?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy.
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I think you got to make lemonade out of lemons.
So that day was very crazy,
but it was also an inflection, a milestone.
You freak out that day?
Yeah.
He paused.
He's like, it's okay to say that you freaked out, bro.
It's traumatic.
I'm sure that was traumatic.
Side note, David, do you remember this?
He wasn't the only guy that got raided,
the only crypto person that got raided.
Actually, Jesse Powell, the founder of Kraken,
got an FBI raided around the same time,
maybe a little earlier, actually.
And he was also vindicated.
So the FBI has dropped all charges against Jesse Powell.
This is sort of a weird thing.
It wasn't related to Jesse's activities at Kraken or crypto.
It was allegations centering around a nonprofit
that he was part of.
And there were allegations of hacking and cyber stalking
that Jesse did.
And so they raided his house, basically.
And they took dozens of electronic devices.
Forgive me, this was actually in 2023,
but you know, similar timing-ish.
They stole laptops, cell phones, all of these things.
And now, Jesse, all charges were dropped
against Jesse as well.
You know, I don't really care what excuse the FBI says
that they have when they raided Jesse from Kraken
and they raided Polymarket.
These anti-democratic, I don't know, actually, no,
excuse me, Shane was just neutral.
Polymarket just reported on the truth,
which I think was offensive to the Democrats.
I don't believe what excuse,
I don't care about the nonprofit that they said
that they raided about.
Like, I'm calling shenanigans.
It felt like that, you know?
We don't know all the facts and circumstances.
Certainly in Shane's case, it was that.
In Jesse's case, it felt like that.
Brian Armstrong even said about Jesse's case,
we still need more progress, but obvious moves like this,
which is vindicating Jesse,
are a good start cleaning up past lawfare.
Man, if that's what that was, lawfare against crypto,
which it seems like it was,
I'm very glad to call that era over.
Although we're not done yet.
Coming up next, we gotta talk about the prosecution
of Roman Storm.
And the DOJ brought a witness to the stand
who apparently had nothing to do with Tornado Cash at all.
We'll talk about that.
Also, Ethereum block's getting bigger
and Zora getting a little pump on the week.
David, you wanna compare Zora and pump, don't you?
The actual pump.
Maybe there's some competition brewing.
We'll get to all that and more, but before we do,
we wanna thank the sponsors

The Ethereum mainnet just processed its largest block ever,
45 million gas units.
That's up from where it was just 12 months ago at 30 million.
So Ethereum blocks are 50% larger than where they were
just like six to nine months ago.
How did that happen?
I'm so glad you asked.
Ethereum block sizes can actually get voted up or down
by Ethereum validators.
So this is an in-protocol feature
that Ethereum can scale or contract its chain
based on a voting of Ethereum validators.
And so more Ethereum validators have been voting saying,
hey, we're ready for more capacity.
Let's give us some more capacity.
And when sufficient critical massive validators
signal for higher gas sizes,
then Ethereum, the protocol, increases the gas size.
And so it trends upwards.
It doesn't like violently move in any direction.
It just kind of slowly trends.
But we just had our first 45 million gas block
on Ethereum layer one.
And people are targeting for more.
They're asking for 60 million in the near to medium term.
I bet we hit 60 million by the end of the year.
That's like, what, a 25% jump in terms of,
when you're saying block sizes,
you're basically talking about transactions per second,
right, the amount of transactions.
Total throughput.
Yeah, so a 25% jump, just on that.
50, 50, 30 to 45% is a 55.
Oh, 30 to, okay, okay.
Very good.
It was 36 initially,
but it's been 30 million gas for a long time.
And then it jumped to 36 recently.
And then it continued going to 45 where we just,
it's not holding 45,
but we're getting 45 million blocks at a time.
This is a part of the donkrod proposal basically
to kind of 3X TPS on Ethereum layer one every year
for the next five years, right?
This is part of that process.
Yeah.
And it's worth noting that there has been a meaningful
shift in priorities for Ethereum protocol upgrades.
This is Pona is tweeting out.
He's an Ethereum developer.
He says, two forks ago, we did not have cheap layer twos.
Two forks from now,
Ethereum will have perfect parallelization of execution.
That's called a block access list, right?
Order of magnitude, more gas limit.
That's what we're talking about right now.
Orders of magnitude, more blobs.
That's pure dust.
And then better censorship resistance.
That's a fossil.
There are some very big things that are getting shipped
to Ethereum that really found out the protocol
in a very big way.
And so we're getting parallelization.
The Ethereum layer one is going to,
it's continuing to scale.
And especially with parallelization,
I think like it's going to be able to fit
quite a lot of activity.
Both meme coin traders and TradFi,
you know, treasury acquisition operations,
all on the layer one.
And that makes me pretty excited.
Yeah, for sure.
I'm speaking of networks that are not sitting still.
Solana is talking about a large tech upgrade
that's incoming.
It's called the BAM protocol.
And this is, Jito introduced this.
So Jito, you know, to me, Jito,
if you're coming from the Ethereum world,
it's a bit like Lido and Lido plus Flashbots plus Geth.
So it's almost like they do client work.
They do MEV protection type work.
And they're also a staking protocol.
That's where most people know them like Lido.
And they are proposing something called BAM,
which is a structure that really trying to fix
or take a crack at fixing the MEV problem on Solana.
And I very much like you, you know,
transactions per second, that's definitely,
you know, you need to increase that
in order to scale block space,
like decentralized transactions per second.
It's very important.
The other thing that's important actually
is minimizing MEV on chain,
because that's a scale limiter as well.
Institutions, users, they're not going to deploy on chain
if they're getting basically raked over the coals.
Do things that are illegal in TradFi,
like most MEV activities are like illegal
to happen in TradFi.
Yeah, and it's legal or illegal.
It's just like, it's bad practice.
You know, I just spent, you know,
you cost me a dollar in slippage for this,
you know, $10 trade, that sucks.
Okay, anyway, some people are,
Mert has said that this is the biggest change
in Solana history.
They haven't encrypted Mempool, app-specific sequencing,
and verifiable ordering so institutions can build
without worrying about MEV.
I didn't get into all of the details of this,
but as I understand, this is very much inspired
by a Flashbots type of design on Ethereum,
and this is Jito kind of adopting some of these practices
and trying to implement it
into a future Solana hard fork, is that right?
That's right, yeah.
Specifically the BuilderNet from Flashbots
where they do a lot of expressive rules-based
order sequencing, transaction sequencing inside of a TEE,
and then you get all of these pretty good properties.
BAM stands for Block Assembly Marketplace,
basically like Flashbots, BuilderNet, like I said.
And yeah, I was like, this feature specifically
is like one of the, in my opinion,
going after Solana's weakest link is like the MEV
and order transaction ordering supply chain.
And so I think this is like a very important upgrade
for Solana.
I agree.
David, speaking of Solana, so I ran across this.
There's actually a civil case that was recently filed
against some of the people we were talking about.
Jito, also Solana, the Solana Foundation, and also Pump.
In fact, the whole thing centers around Pump.
And this is, we've seen a lot of court cases before,
including civil cases.
This is the first time I've seen a civil case of this type,
okay, which is they are charging,
they are alleging that these entities,
so Pump on the app layer, Solana, and Jito,
together inspired to create an unlicensed on-chain casino.
So they're invoking RICO laws, RICO, the R in RICO.
Yeah, that stands for racketeering,
basically racketeering laws.
If you're not familiar with that term either,
it means it's when you combine wire fraud
and illegal gambling and unlicensed money transmission
all together, that's called racketeering.
It's like casino license type rules,
stuff the mob was doing before, that's racketeering.
And they're alleging that these entities conspired
to racketeer, they created conditions
for an online casino, essentially, a meme coin casino,
that turns Solana into an unlicensed algorithmic slot machine
for meme coins, costing the plaintiffs here
billions of dollars.
And so the way they got to billions
is all the fees from Pump, plus, interestingly enough,
the MEV fees in Jito, plus the price appreciation
of Sol the token, they got to like three billion or so.
They're lumping all these things together?
They're lumping it all together, which is interesting.
They're saying all of these entities together
are creating basically an on-chain casino.
And they pulled up some quotes, you know?
So of course you got the Pump Fund founder,
here's a tweet, greatest casino,
it's all part of the experience,
it's a privilege, the Pump.Fund CEO,
on August 8th, there was a tweet in the complaint here.
You also have people like Mert that were quoted here.
The Solana fee model is stochastic on purpose
to naturally simulate a casino environment.
So on the one hand, this looks like
it could be a frivolous lawsuit, right?
It's just like, oh, here's some money,
here's meme coin casino, we're gonna go after the money
and see if we can do it.
And I think that's probably the base case
of what this is.
On the other hand, I get worried
that this could set a precedent,
it's not for a civil case, but for a DOJ type case,
you know, a federal case at some point in time,
if the climate in the US changes
to something like it was back in 2023, 2024.
So it's gonna be an interesting case to watch for sure.
Yeah, okay.
When I hear class action lawsuits in crypto,
my mind immediately goes to the pool together,
frivolous lawsuit, where somebody just like added,
put money into pool together, lost it,
and then sued them for being like an unregistered lottery.
Yeah.
Which the pool together is not a lottery.
And that one turned out to be political, right?
That was like-
Yeah, turned out that person worked for Elizabeth Warren,
and it was very frivolous and opportunistic lawyers.
So when I see a class action lawsuit, especially in crypto,
I'm like, okay, all right, who's trying again?
Yeah, I've seen this before.
Class action lawsuits can become a big payday for lawyers.
And then they're advocating,
they're representing millions of people
who lost billions of dollars.
And then when it's all said and done,
and say the lawyers win the lawsuit,
the average individual gets like a $7 check,
and the lawyers walk away with like $100 million.
For sure.
I don't know what's going on here.
Could be that.
It could be that.
And I think it should be considered that
until proven otherwise.
It's just worrisome.
I mean, this kind of lawsuit could be brought
against Ethereum, let's say, right?
And it could be brought against layer twos,
all sorts of things.
If this goes forward, I think, I don't know,
could pave the way for some other nasty stuff.
David, Coinbase offering perp futures
to US citizens for a first.
Your Bitcoin or your Ether,
you can get them on perps in Coinbase.
That's new.
You ever trade any perps, David?
I am an expert perp trader.
Are you?
You call me Mr. Perp?
Yeah, that's right.
Everyone knows I'm the world's greatest perp trader.
Everyone, they tune into the podcast,
they hear about the perp trading.
We finally got them in the US,
because all of this has to be CFTC regulated,
and now it is on Coinbase.
Now we get to watch perp volumes on Coinbase
compete with hyper liquid perp volumes.
And then also when Robinhood rolls it out,
Robinhood too, that's going to be interesting to watch.
There was more news from Coinbase.
PNC Bank and Coinbase announced a partnership.
What's going on with this partnership?
Okay, so I recently did an episode, Coin versus Hood.
It was a very, very illuminating episode.
And we, on the two guests,
really drilled down the strategy that Coinbase is doing,
where they are trying to basically be the crypto backend
for TradFi institutions who don't want to do it themselves.
And so PNC Bank looks like it's one of those,
but you could imagine like Fidelity
or anyone who wants to allow their customers
to trade crypto,
they kind of just whitelist Coinbase
and plug into Coinbase in the backend.
Looks like that's what's happening here.
And so Coinbase is being the crypto backend
for PNC Bank, is that what's going on?
That's what's going on.
I feel like every bank is going to,
first of all, post genius act, they're like,
okay, you know, stable coins crypto is fine.
It's fully regulated, game on.
So now they have to have a strategy.
Are they going to build out all of the crypto functionality?
Do they have the teams?
These are banks, man.
They do not have the teams in place
to deploy the custodial technology,
the exchange technology of the Coinbase.
So what are they going to do?
They're going to open it for their customers,
but they're going to use entities,
crypto native entities like Coinbase on the backend.
That's great.
And the relationship works the other way too,
which is Coinbase gets a good banking partner
on their side too.
So it gives them a bit more being debanked insurance,
I suppose.
You know, in the future, if you have your-
I wonder how much TTSD from the last four years
is like indicative like,
Shane wants to take Polymarket public
rather than issue a token because he wants more insurance.
Brian Armstrong wants as many banking partners as possible
because he doesn't want to be debanked.
I wonder how much-
Never again, right?
It's got to be a never again type attitude.
David, we should update folks on the Roman Storm trial.
So it is the second week, the first full week,
and it's really been the prosecution so far.
Were you following some of the highlights from this?
I was reading it loosely.
I think you pay attention to it more than I was though.
Yeah, I did.
So the big news on the week,
the big thing that kind of blew up,
which was very interesting to me
is that we almost got a mistrial, okay?
This is at least what Roman Storm's defense attorneys
were calling for.
They were saying, all right, this has gone too far.
We need a mistrial.
On what grounds?
Yeah, on the ground.
So you remember last week,
we talked a little bit about some of the witnesses
that the prosecution will bring to the stand.
Well, one was a very sad story of a Katie Lin,
it's an air quotes, it's pseudo-anonymous, I imagine,
who made five total deposits totaling roughly $250,000
to a sketchy platform called NTU Capital.
This is called a pig butchering scheme.
Okay, have you heard of that pig butchering scheme?
I'm assuming we're not literally talking
about pig butchering.
No, we're not.
Okay, it's a common scam scheme.
It's called pig butchering.
And the idea is you fatten up the pig
and then you slaughter them, okay?
So the pig in this case is the victim
and it's a pretty traditional scam
and it usually begins in a telegram chat.
In this case, it was a WhatsApp chat.
Somebody pings you and they're like, hey, how are you?
We just ran across one another.
And suddenly, David,
they've got this incredible investment opportunity.
They kind of get to know you, you're back and forth.
They build trust that way.
And eventually the victim sends them funds
into this fake opportunity
that seems real to them at the time.
And then of course, they steal all of their money.
And at the end, they usually try to manipulate them
into investing more before that.
And then they end up cutting the victim off
and oftentimes just making fun of them after the fact.
Like, I stole all your money, see you later, right?
It's kind of sad.
What does this have to do with tornado cash?
Exactly.
Okay, so let me guess.
The exploiter, the criminal, use tornado cash.
Okay, that's what they were claiming.
So they had a sad story from Katie Lin,
a legitimately sad story.
We've heard this so many times.
This is not just crypto.
This is just like everyday type scam.
And what the prosecution was saying is,
and then they use some of the funds, some of the proceeds,
the hackers and the scammers, through tornado cash.
And when Katie Lin emailed the generic tornado cash email,
bounce back, generic thing, she didn't get a reply.
All right, so that was the case.
But what they were trying to do is they were trying to tug
on the heartstrings of the jurors, right?
Look at all the bad things happen.
Roman Storm, he enabled all of this.
All of these scams, all of these victims,
all of these pig butchering schemes, it's all happening.
Okay, but there was only one problem with that, David.
They didn't even use tornado cash in this instance.
Wait, what?
What?
What did they use?
What was the purpose then?
If they didn't, what was the association?
The DOJ apparently thought that maybe tornado cash
was being used, but when it turns out,
we've got the best super sleuths in the business
in crypto Twitter, okay?
Well, you've got Taylor Monahan pulled up.
Oh, that's true.
Zach XBT, people like Taylor Monahan,
they went through and they traced it, okay?
And according to this very case, the $250,000,
there's no evidence that any of those funds
went to tornado cash.
There's evidence that some of these funds went to exchanges.
I won't name them, but there's a few exchanges on the list.
They're not on the stand.
None of it went to tornado cash, okay?
So you're telling me the prosecution
brought on this sob story.
Yes.
God's a jury to sob as hard as they could,
and then they were like, and here's Roman Storm.
Yes, yes.
Exactly.
Yeah, exactly.
So they basically were blaming Roman Storm
for somebody getting scammed in crypto, right?
And you're painting him as the perpetrator here.
Why didn't they go after the scammer?
Great question.
Also, there's other parties involved.
I mean, you could blame the internet.
You could blame the Ethereum blockchain.
I do blame the internet.
You blame the internet.
The internet made all this possible.
Who can we get the CEO of the internet
and hold them responsible for this?
I mean, that's basically what's going on in this case.
Now, the defense demanded a mistrial, basically.
And then the prosecution, last minute,
they parachuted in a witness, an expert witness,
an IRS agent that said, no, no, no, actually,
I do see part of this 9.78 of this $250,000
went to tornado cash, is what he tried to say.
Yeah, and then under the cross-examination,
the expert witness actually admitted
that this doesn't prove the hacker
actually did the tornado cash.
And experts on crypto Twitter are like,
they're doing it wrong.
We can see it on chain.
We're tracing it in the correct way.
None of it went to tornado cash.
Even the expert witness says he may have been wrong,
but this prevented a mistrial.
So that's some of the shenanigans going on right now.
I think Jake Churwinski had a great take.
In an update from Roman Storm's trial,
he said DOJ had years to prepare for this.
And so far, their case is basically crypto is bad.
Their first witness had literally nothing to do
with Roman Storm or tornado cash.
DOJ is trying to imprison a DeFi developer,
and this is the best they can do.
Well, I'm not in the jury,
and so I have a lot more context
and education about crypto than...
They're seeing none of this, by the way, right?
...likely the jury does.
Exactly.
But I hope that the jury understands enough
that they should be fucking annoyed
that they are there.
You've wasted our time.
Why are you wasting our time?
David, even the witness...
Prove that he's guilty or get out of here.
Even the witness, okay?
She had to relive all of her trauma,
went through this, right?
The DOJ told...
Tornado cash wasn't even part of that.
Right.
Why is she there?
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm not Roman Storm's defense counsel,
but I'm kind of...
They can ask for a mistrial,
but if it's a mistrial,
can't the prosecution just go back and try again?
But if they lose the case,
then they can't go back and try again.
Yeah, yeah.
And so I'm a fan of this teetering on the edge
between being a mistrial and not a mistrial
because if it's so close to being a mistrial,
then it's likely that he's going to be
just like excused.
Yeah, we'll see.
I mean, it depends what the jury thinks about this.
They still have some ammo on the prosecution side.
They're trying to say that Roman had control
over the front end.
He should have taken it down.
They're calling expert witnesses
from the government who are saying,
no, this is how Tornado cash should have worked
to prevent any money laundering and that sort of thing.
So we'll have to see.
Meanwhile, Roman Storm is getting debanked all the time.
Gusto just canceled his payroll stuff, right?
That's happening in the background.
But next week, the defense presents the case
and then closing arguments could be mid next week
and a final verdict could be on the table on Friday.
So big week next week.
Eight days from the time of recording.
Yeah, and I think we're going to be trying to talk
to some of the reporters who've been covering this
fantastically well at The Rage.
Shout out The Rage.
They have been covering the Tornado cash case very well.
There's a link in the show notes
and we'll hopefully be talking to them next.
So David, Zora versus Pump.
What do you want to get into here?
It's a pretty strong juxtaposition going on right now
between PumpFun and Zora.
And PumpFun has had a ton of attention
ever since the Pump token launch.
So maybe to recap some of the details,
there was a very large ICO for the Pump token
at $4 billion valuation sold out within minutes.
And then something like a $700 million raise,
both from private VCs in the private sale
and then also on the public sale to ended individuals.
$700 million sold out very quickly.
The Pump launched at like $5 billion.
So an immediate 25% return got up to $6 billion.
Things looking pretty good.
And since then, there's just been a lack of communication
out of the Pump team.
And also since then, there's a new token launcher,
token launch pad called Bonk.
Bonk, and Bonk is taking 60 to 70%
of token launch pad volumes.
And so Pump is actually, as of July, the month of July,
Pump is not the dominant token launch pad volume
based on volume on Solana.
Pump, the Pump founder, Alon,
went on to a live stream with Thread Guy.
And it was very watched live stream.
I think there was something like 5,000 or 6,000
concurrent live viewers,
which kind of gives you an indication
about how many people are watching this.
People were asked, like waiting for clarity,
like, okay, what happens next?
Because there was a Pump airdrop that was promised.
We're looking for the Pump live streaming future.
Overall, there was a lot of the community
that were looking for indication as like,
what happens next?
A lot of people invested into Pump at $4 billion.
And there was just a lot of missing communication,
I think people felt from the Pump team
about what happens next.
During the Pump live stream,
right as Alon said that there was going to be an airdrop,
but not in the immediate future.
There'd be no, there's going to be an airdrop,
but not in the immediate future
is when the Pump token loses,
goes from $4 billion in value to $3 billion in value.
And so there's some frustration on the Pump side of things.
And overall, I'll blame that very high expectations
that a $4 billion valuation leads to.
And so like at $4 billion,
where like people gave $700 million of the money to,
that's the bar that's set.
Now let's go over to the flip side of things.
The Zora app mints are up only,
and there's no second best in the Ethereum landscape.
I bet you it doesn't actually hold a candle
to Solana launch pads.
So like Solana launch pads
are just launching much more assets in general.
But you got me onto the Zora app once again,
for like the third time today.
Or this week.
Yeah, you were saying last week,
you were just saying,
no, Zora's not for me.
If you download the Zora app,
you can just imagine Normies having a ton of fun.
And it's exactly like FriendTech.
So when you go on to Zora,
you can launch your token.
And then, I bought some Ryan,
Ryan bought some of me.
I'm at a humble $112,000 market cap.
And then I launched a picture.
So I posted a picture and it's got like a $1,000 market cap.
And there's like 36 buyers of it.
I've earned $13 from it.
It's just fun.
Go ahead.
It's interesting that you're comparing them though,
because I see Zora's completely different versus Pump.
I see them as the same dude.
Alan is all about creators.
Creating like tokenizing creators,
using tokens and running with attention.
It's not like wrapped in a social network, right?
It's just, or I guess maybe that's what they're doing.
They're saying they're trying to disrupt Switch.
You know, Twitch, right?
They're trying to disrupt Twitch.
That's right.
And so they're going after streaming,
but Zora is going after like social media.
But they're both trying to reward creators
by having tokens and capturing attention.
Now, the difference here is the Zora token market cap
earlier this week.
So Zora started the week coming in at a market cap
of just about $38 million.
Now that's not fully diluted.
Fully diluted was maybe something about $400 million.
So $400 million.
It has pumped in the last seven days, 300%, 300%.
So it went from a market cap of $34 million
up to $175 million.
And I think it's just because the expectations
are totally different.
Like Pump has a huge expectations at $4 billion.
Now it's clocking in below $3 billion.
And everyone's kind of written off Zora.
All the trench people have like kind of written off Zora.
But the Zora app is so polished and it's so good.
And it does the same thing.
It does the same thing as Pump.
It's, I've never been a heavy Pump user,
but I did engage in the Friend Tech experiment.
And it reminds me so much of what Friend Tech was.
Have you ever bought a token on PumpFun?
No, I've never done.
No, you have not.
Yeah, not at all.
Not even been tempted.
I like, I just don't really care.
But like, I don't know, Zora is kind of fun.
Now I will tell you this.
I have no idea what to like post on Zora.
I just haven't figured that out.
Like it's, like I know how to tweet on Twitter.
I know what Instagram is like.
The post on Zora, there's almost like for me,
there's like the pressure of like,
oh, it's gotta be good.
Because people spend money on this thing.
So what do you post?
I think it's iconic memes.
I like truly iconic stuff, like viral moments.
Like if we posted a clip of Sam Bankman-Free
getting rattled under the focus of Eric Voorhees,
that would have gone super viral.
That would have gone mega-meme.
It has to be at the time probably, right?
You have to capture the clip fast.
Yes.
It's highly related to attention, in my opinion.
And I think you're onto something where,
like the content form factor that's resonant
with Instagram or the content form factor
that's resonant with TikTok or Twitter,
every medium is its own modality.
Yeah.
I think that's a correct second.
And so, like what goes viral on Pump or Zora
is gonna have its own kind of form factor.
And like Zora native creators are gonna figure that out.
And they're gonna be the leading creators on Zora.
Oh, we'll see what it does.
It's all crypto people there still, right?
You need some big celebrity type creators
to kind of like get this thing off the ground,
but maybe that's coming next.
We will end it there.
Guys, of course, none of this has been financial advice.
It never is.
You know crypto is risky.
So are meme coins, Pump tokens, Zora, Treasuries,
all the things you could put in.
I've lost $5,000 on Zora this week.
There it is.
In the disclaimers.
We are headed west.
This is the frontier.
It's not for everyone,
but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
Thanks a lot.
