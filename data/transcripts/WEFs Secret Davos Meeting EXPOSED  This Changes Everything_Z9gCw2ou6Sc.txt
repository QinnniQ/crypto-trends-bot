Once a year the global elite gather at the World Economic Forum or WEF's annual winter conference
in Davos, Switzerland to discuss the future of the world without our input.
But you probably knew that already.
That part I already knew.
What you may not know though is that the WEF hosts another annual summer conference in China
called the annual meeting of the new champions.
It seems this year's edition didn't get much media attention though.
That's why today we're going to bring you up to speed on everything that happened at this year's
so-called Summer Davos and what it means for you and the markets.
My name is Guy and unlike your stepfather's latest wedding,
this video is something you don't want to miss.
Let's start with a quick recap.
If you watched our summary of last year's annual meeting of the new champions,
you'll know that the event focuses on the next individuals and institutions
that are likely to change the world.
In other words, it focuses on the next generation of elites being propped up by the WEF.
Now for context, the WEF is aware that if it wants to continue to be relevant,
then it needs a steady stream of new elites to rule over us.
And to that end, the WEF has been working on recruiting young global shapers
who ensure the WEF's agendas are met in cities
and young global leaders who ensure the WEF's agendas are met in countries.
In fact, many young global leaders have gone on to become presidents and prime ministers.
And no, this is not a conspiracy theory.
This is not a conspiracy.
Many of you will know that the WEF's founder and former chairman, Klaus Schwab,
famously revealed in an interview that the WEF had
quote, penetrated the cabinets of governments in major countries,
helping to install leaders such as Angela Merkel in Germany and Justin Trudeau in Canada.
We'll leave a link to that clip in the description if you don't believe us.
It is crazy.
Now, speaking of Klaus, some of you will also know that he stepped down
as WEF chairman a few months ago.
If you watched our summary of this year's Davos conference,
you'll know he literally congratulated himself for making the world a better place
with the help of the elites at the WEF.
Others would argue that the WEF has in fact made things worse
and that his departure marked the beginning of the organization's end.
As it so happens, this seems to have been the vibe
at this year's annual meeting of the new champions,
which took place at the end of June in Tianjin, China.
The difference in atmosphere between this year's and last year's conference was noticeable,
at least to us.
It's just not the same when you don't have Klaus coming on stage
to say he wants to replace all of us with robots in a Bond villain accent.
Instead, we got Borger Brenda, the president and CEO of the WEF,
who gives off the aura of a creepy schoolteacher
rather than cutthroat globalist technocrat.
Well, makes a nice change, I suppose.
On that note, what's interesting is that the WEF has yet to announce
a new chairman at the time of shooting.
After Klaus stepped down, former Nestle chairman and CEO
Peter Brabek-Lekmata was announced as interim chairman and continues in the role.
Now, if that name sounds familiar, that's because Peter is infamous
for claiming that water is not a human right a few years back.
Peter has since changed his stance, at least according to Nestle's website.
In any case, it's clear that Peter is a lot more cutthroat than Borger
and it gives us a sense of what the WEF's next chairman is going to be like.
Nobody seems to be rushing to take the role and it's easy to see why.
As things get harder around the world, the average person is looking for someone to blame.
The WEF is perhaps the easiest target as it consists of the most powerful
individuals and institutions, many of whom are directly responsible
for creating the stagnant economy and growing wealth inequality that we see today.
The more these trends continue, the more scrutiny there will be
around powerful organizations like the WEF.
At the same time, we're starting to see a bifurcation in the global order,
with two distinct polls emerging, a Chinese poll and a US poll.
This fact could be felt at this year's Summer Davos.
Speakers were hesitant to say anything that could result in a tariff chokeslam from Trump
and nearly whispered when discussing things like the tensions between the US and China
or the BRICS moving away from the US dollar.
Thankfully, they said enough that it's worth covering and there is a lot to cover.
But before we get into all that, if you're enjoying the video so far,

Now, the theme of this year's Summer Davos was quote
entrepreneurship for a new era and it took place right when things were getting spicy.
Israel had just struck Iran and it looked like the conflict was on the brink of escalating into a
regional war.
For reference, Iran exports 90% of its oil to China and China imports 15% of its oil from Iran.
You'll recall the Summer Davos took place in China.
This made for a very tense backdrop.
In any case, for the sake of simplicity, we'll break down our summary of the conference by day,
starting with the panels on day one.
The first one that caught our eye was called quote contours of a new economic order.
In case it wasn't clear enough, it focused on the changing world order I noted earlier.
After the moderator noted that Iran and Israel were fighting as they spoke,
Columbia professor Jeffrey Friedan stated the obvious,
and that's that the US has kept the world largely in order since the 1950s,
but that this order is starting to turn into chaos.
Notably, Jeffrey pointed to the weakening of institutions such as the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, which helped project US dominance globally.
John Hopkins University professor Ang Yuan Yuan chimed in with her hot take,
which was that the reshoring and re-industrialization we're seeing in the US and elsewhere
has nothing to do with economics.
It has to do with populism and national security.
This makes it fundamentally different from the other kinds of industrialization trends
we've seen in countries like China, which are primarily economic.
Notably, Ang said that this fact means that other countries,
which were counting on industrialization to grow their economies,
will have to take a different strategy.
To bring you up to speed, many economists believe that economies follow a sort of
natural progression of growth, from production to consumption.
So, it looks like either the economists or the developing countries
will have to come up with a new approach.
Ang said that countries like China, which managed to industrialize before the door
started closing on the old kind of economic globalization,
should be able to pivot from production to consumption.
The caveat is that people don't consume or invest when there's lots of uncertainty.
As you'll soon see, this is a big problem that the WEF is struggling to address.
And it's an even bigger problem when you consider that the WEF wants
AI and robots to replace labour.
Now, I'm not sure if they've noticed, but AI and robots do not consume.
Humans do.
So, if you want to grow the economy through consumption,
you need to empower workers and not replace them with technology.
This is a fact that Carlson Tong, the chairman of Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing,
seems to have forgotten.
But back to Jeffrey.
Now, he was one of the only big cheeses we saw speaking at the WEF
who understands how big of a problem uncertainty is for consumption and the flow of capital.
He's the only one who highlighted the fact that uncertainty is highest in developing countries,
which happen to be the ones that need the most consumption
and capital investment in order to grow.
He also underscored the need for long-term certainty.
Now, we couldn't help but be reminded here of something chilling
that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in an interview a few years back.
Markets don't like uncertainty.
Markets like totalitarian governments.
And democracies are very messy, as we know in the United States.
Link is down below, FYI.
Put simply, powerful individuals and institutions prefer countries like China
because they know exactly what to expect in the future and can plan for it.
The scariest thing about this fact is that you could argue that the average person
also prefers this totalitarian stability.
It would help explain the rise of more authoritarian parties around the world.
The only real difference is that some are left-wing and some are right-wing.
Anyways, another panel that caught our eye was titled,
Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025.
Now, believe it or not, but the discussion wasn't all that focused on AI.
Instead, it was focused on biotechnology, with panellists discussing everything from
drugs that permanently live inside your body to sensors that will exist in your body
and that can be detected by objects in your surroundings like cars.
If you're terminally online, you might have seen the viral clip of a scientist named Matthew Lau
proposing genetically modifying humans to make them allergic to meat
so they eat less meat and save the planet or whatever.
Matthew doesn't seem to be a part of the WEF nor were his comments made at a WEF event,
but it was along the same lines as the Top 10 Emerging Technologies panel.
Dystopian.
Anyhow, yet another panel that caught our eye was titled,
Chief Economists Briefing.
That's because it continued discussing something that was briefly discussed
during the Contours of a New Economic Order panel,
and that's the EU's role in this emerging world order.
Geoffrey had briefly noted that the most fascinating relationship to watch in the
coming years will be that between the EU and China.
In the Chief Economists Briefing,
Thai economic adviser Santitan Satiratai argued that the EU could become the third pole in the
new world order.
The key word there is could.
He acknowledged the fact that just because the EU has the chance
doesn't mean that it can capitalise on it.
Many challenges remain, namely the fragmentation of European capital markets
and the sovereignty of EU economies.
If you watched our recent video about the EU's plans to use the savings of Europeans to fund its
ideological agendas, you'll know that these plans are essentially a backdoor for parts of the
economic and capital markets union that was previously rejected by most EU countries.
When you remember that institutions like BlackRock prefer authoritarian regimes,
it paints a pretty bleak picture for Europe under the EU.
And this ties into another panel that caught our eye, which was titled quote
Reading the US Economy.
It perfectly portrayed the approach that the global elites have towards us plebs
as data points in their models.
First, American university professor Robert Koopman suggested that he was happy that many
people who came into the US illegally aren't being caught because it will make the economy strong.
Then, Bloomberg editor Stacey Vanek-Smith said that reshoring will cause wages to rise,
which is a bad thing because it will cause inflation.
As a not-so-fun fact, panelists at previous WEF discussions had revealed that the US needed a
steady stream of 500,000 new workers a month to ensure wages remained under control.
This could explain why there was so much illegal immigration under the previous administration.
Whatever the case, it appears that the average person is starting to realize
that abstract measures like GDP don't directly reflect their quality of life.
However, it appears that the average person still doesn't understand that the powers that be
need GDP to rise, even if it's at your expense.
That's just because if GDP starts to slow, debts become harder to repay,
and powerful institutions and individuals will default.
If you need evidence of this, look no further than the efforts being made by BlackRock & Co
to get retail investors to start buying private equity and private credit.
Many analysts have rightfully pointed out that their attempts to sell
institutional products to retail is evidence of problems behind the scenes.
Italian politician Valentino Valentini actually confirmed this during a panel titled
Trade Trends and End Games.
He revealed that exits in the private equity space are becoming more difficult,
which is why they're trying to do it through the public markets.
He also said that EU countries need to give up their negotiating power to go along with the consensus.
Sounds kind of authoritarian, doesn't it?
But back to BlackRock.
On the second day of the Summer Davos event, the Opening Plenary was held.
It was hosted by Borga Brenda, the aforementioned WEF CEO and President,
and featured a keynote speech by Chinese Premier Li Qiyong,
who insisted that globalization is not disappearing,
it's merely changing, undergoing a quote, new path.
If you watched our recent video about Larry Fink's letter in the Financial Times,
you'll know that BlackRock is already thinking about this so-called
second draft of globalization.
In theory, it means giving more power to workers and building public infrastructure.
In practice, it means importing cheap labor to build private infrastructure,
which will then be monetized by asset managers like BlackRock.
And it's not just the blue collar jobs either.
In a panel titled, quote, Building an Agentic Economy,
Von Vu, the co-founder and CEO of an English learning AI called ELSA,
revealed that many American companies are not using AI to replace workers.
They're using AI to train cheap overseas labor
and then replacing homegrown workers with this cheap overseas labor.
Of course, English language skills are just one part of that.
On a different note, another panel called, quote, Currencies in Flux,
actively discussed the decline of the US dollar.
What's funny is that every panelist was walking on eggshells except for one,
Diana Choyleva, senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.
She not only ranted about how the sanctions on Russia in 2022 hurt the US dollar's dominance,
but argued that the Liberation Day tariffs had the same effect.
Meanwhile, Cornell University Professor Eswar Prasad pointed out that the euro's use in
central bank reserves has been falling just as much as the US dollar's use in central bank reserves,
suggesting it won't be the currency that dethrones the US dollar.
Now, this makes sense considering that the EU is closely aligned with the US,
and this makes the euro just as problematic as the US dollar in the eyes of many countries.
London School of Economics Professor Jin Kayu took a different angle.
She correctly pointed out that there's still a US dollar shortage globally,
meaning that the demand for US dollars is likely to continue indefinitely.
As a fun fact, this is because of the tens, possibly hundreds of trillions,
of US dollar-denominated debt that exists.
This debt is effectively a demand driver for US dollars globally.
Diana dialled up the rhetoric by pointing out another important fact,
and that's that it's not the US dollar that's a problem per se, but the rails that it runs on.
This is something we discovered in our research of the BRICS and its proposed BRICS currency.
What's needed is an alternative payment system, not an alternative currency per se.
The system the BRICS is working on is Enbridge, which Diana also referenced.
As a cherry on top, Diana reminded everyone of oil's role in driving US dollar demand
and claimed that one-fifth of all dollar demand comes from the oil trade.
This is presumably why jurisdictions like the EU and China are so obsessed with getting away
from fossil fuels and moving towards green energy.
Not only does it make their energy grids more independent,
it also makes them less dependent on the US dollar.
Both Jin and Eswar reiterated these facts, with Jin repeating that the US dollar
and the US-led financial system are two separate things, with Eswar repeating
that there continues to be enormous US dollar demand, as evidenced by stable coins,
which are mostly US dollar denominated.
Eswar's conclusion was legit.
Stable coins aren't the solution to problematic currencies.
The currencies themselves must be fixed.
Whereas the problem with the euro is fragmentation,
the problem with the Chinese yuan is the free flow of capital.
Without the free flow of capital, it's not possible for China to have capital markets
that are deep or liquid enough for investors to park their money in,
never mind the risk of confiscation.
Until either or both of these problems are solved, the US dollar will continue to remain dominant.
This relates to the third day of the event,
where a panel titled
Understanding China's Approach to AI caught our attention.
Aside from the fact that energy was a hot topic due to the electricity demands of AI,
University of Southern California Professor Angela Zhang Huiyue
revealed that US AI companies are focused on building powerful models,
while Chinese AI companies are focused on applications.
And that reminds me, there weren't nearly as many discussions about AI as you'd expect,
given the theme of the event, and even the discussions that were about AI
focused on things that are adjacent to AI, such as energy and infrastructure.
For example, Li Haitao, the Dean of the Cheng Hong Graduate School of Business,
predicted that there will be a decoupling between Chinese and US AI infrastructure.
In fact, he went as far as specifying that quote,
Trump will do something to hold China back.
While this could have simply been a reference to restrictions around AI chips,
it could just as easily be a reference to the possibility
that there will be an escalation between China and Taiwan that's caused by the US.
This isn't speculation.
Xi Jinping reportedly alleged that the US wants to trick China into attacking Taiwan.
And this pertains to another panel titled quote,
Geopolitics An Unfolding Story, where Harvard Kennedy School Professor Graham Allison
talked about another hot topic at the event, the Thucydides Trap.
For those unfamiliar, this describes a historical phenomenon
where the world is plunged into chaos as an established power is threatened by an emerging
power, in this case, China threatening the US.
To put things into perspective, a 2012 study conducted by Harvard
found that there were 16 cases of a rising power threatening an established power
over the last 500 years.
In 12 of these 16 cases, the result was war, so 75% of the time.
Jin actually dropped that statistic during the previously mentioned panel, by the way.
News flash, but this suggests there's a high chance that the US and China
will go to war at some point.
Oddly enough, though, Jin claimed that China's domestic issues are bigger than its international
issues at this point in time.
To clarify, she was also a part of the geopolitics panel.
Now, this honestly isn't too reassuring because many American analysts claim that
China will attack Taiwan as a means of preserving domestic order.
After all, creating an external enemy is the best way to unite a population, supposedly.
But back to the AI stuff.
Another oddity was the fact that panelists continued to talk about China's DeepSeek
moment even though it happened way back in January.
In case you missed it, DeepSeek is an open source Chinese AI that was apparently more
powerful than many US AI models.
The catch is that DeepSeek was much cheaper to develop, calling into question
all the AI spending that's been happening in the US.
Now, besides the fact that these panelists would say that the AI model matters less than
the AI application in the same breath, we actually didn't see anyone provide any
groundbreaking applications for AI.
This was surprising because the entire purpose of the event was to find the young people
working on these up-and-coming technologies, but it was mostly buzzwords and discussions
around infrastructure.
It seems that even the application-focused Chinese are struggling to find applications
for AI.
One of the only exceptions seems to be robotics, but even then, panelists working for robotics
companies admitted that robots would continue to be designed for specific tasks.
The idea of some general-purpose humanoid robot that replaces people still seems to
be science fiction, at least until AGI gets developed.
Come to think of it, it's possible that OpenAI's upcoming GPT-5 model will come
close to counting as AGI, and it's safe to assume that technology companies will have
every incentive to claim this as a means of boosting their stocks.
In case you missed the memo, GPT-5 will be announced sometime over the summer.
It goes without saying that it'll have some interesting effects on the US and on China,
for that matter.
Now, this brings me to the big question, and that's what all of this means for you
and for the markets.
Based on what was said at the WEF Summer Davos, the answer to the former seems to be more
economic, political and social uncertainty because of a gradual decoupling between the
US and China.
The answer to the latter isn't any different.
Turbulent and volatile markets as investors try and position themselves accordingly.
The key takeaway from this year's annual meeting of the new champions is that the
world is changing and that nobody knows what the new world will look like, not even the
WEF's biggest thinkers.
Although they hint at things like wanting more authoritarian governments to create
certainty, they don't seem entirely on board with the idea because those governments could
easily turn against them.
One thing is for sure though, and that's that the WEF is desperate to stay relevant
in this changing world.
The good news is that this doesn't seem to be working because recent changes in politics
and public opinion seem to have stopped the WEF's agendas dead in their tracks.
The bad news is that the WEF isn't giving up and still seems dead set on achieving its
ideological goals by 2030.
FYI, the reason why you see the 2030 date everywhere is because that's when the United
Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, are supposed to be met in every country.
The SDGs include dystopian technologies like CBDCs and digital IDs, which are intended
to be implemented in public-private partnerships.
The ESG investment ideology explicitly seeks to help achieve the UN's SDGs.
Now, if you've been keeping up with our coverage of ESG and the SDGs, you'll know
that those SDGs were first called the Millennial Development Goals, or MDGs, and they were
supposed to be met by 2015.
This deadline was missed mostly because of the global financial crisis, so the UN rebranded
and tried again.
Some would say we're headed for a similar scenario with another financial crisis possibly
around the corner.
So this begs the question of whether the outcome will be the same.
Will the plans of the global elite be foiled because of the next financial crisis like
last time, or will they use it to their advantage to implement their new world order this time
around?
Give us your answers in the comments below.
And once you're done, check out our video about why consumer debt could be the trigger
for the next financial crisis using the link in the top right.
If you made it this far, thank you as always for watching, and I'll see you in the next
one.
This is Guy, signing off.
