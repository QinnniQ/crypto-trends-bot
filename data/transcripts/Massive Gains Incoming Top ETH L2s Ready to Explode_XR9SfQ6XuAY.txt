As Ethereum's price pumps, everyone is wondering where that capital will rotate to next.
And the answer could be Ethereum's own Layer 2 ecosystem.
Most Layer 2 tokens are still significantly down from their all-time highs,
and this means they have even more upside potential.
Even more!
And that's why today we're going to tell you everything you need to know about
Ethereum's largest Layer 2s, including
How to access them
Where to find projects within their ecosystem
And how high their native tokens could go
My name is Nick and this is a video you don't want to miss.
Before we begin, you need to know that I am not a financial advisor
and nothing in this video should be considered as financial or investment advice.
This video is purely for your education and entertainment,
intended to inform you about 5 of Ethereum's leading Layer 2s.
Also, do note that some team members at CoinBureau
do hold some of the tokens we will be covering today.
But we promise to be as objective as always in our analysis.
So, if you're ready to get into it, fire up those like buttons,
don't forget to subscribe and ping that notification bell as well.
And let's begin.
First, let's start with what Layer 2s actually are and how they work.
As most of you will no doubt know,
Ethereum's biggest weakness is that it's slow and expensive.
Now, to remedy this, separate blockchains called Layer 2s or L2s
are built as second layers on top of Ethereum, which is the Layer 1.
These L2s inherit Ethereum's security,
while making the network faster and cheaper to use.
The reason why L2s are necessary is because Ethereum was designed
to be secure and decentralized.
The trade-off, though, is that scalability takes a bit of a hit.
Achieving all three of these features, security, decentralization, and scalability,
is a theoretically impossible challenge,
often referred to as the, quote, blockchain trilemma,
a term actually coined by Ethereum's creator Viptalic Buterin himself.
L2 roll-up solutions aim to address the scalability aspect of Ethereum's trilemma.
Roll-up solutions will literally roll up transactions into a bundle,
process them off-chain,
and then send that data back to Ethereum as a single transaction.
And this allows for faster Ethereum transactions at a fraction of the cost.
Now, you should know that there are several types of roll-up solutions,
each with their own pros and cons.
The most used variants are optimistic roll-ups and zero-knowledge roll-ups.
Optimistic roll-ups are optimistic because they assume
off-chain transactions are legit unless proven otherwise.
Validators get a one-week challenge period to check the data,
and then can submit fraud proofs if they spot anything dodgy.
Conversely, zero-knowledge roll-ups, or ZK roll-ups,
focus on privacy by using complex cryptography to verify transactions
without exposing sensitive information.
Unlike optimistic roll-ups, they don't assume validity.
Instead, they submit validity proofs to smart contracts to prove transactions are legit.
ZK roll-ups are usually faster than optimistic roll-ups
since there's no one-week challenge period, which has helped their adoption.
The trade-off is that generating ZK proofs takes a ton of computing power,
creating other hurdles that are, frankly, outside the scope of this video.
Now, before we go any further,
if you're looking to trade any cryptos mentioned in today's video,
or any others for that matter,
then you need to check out the Coin Bureau Deals page.
That's where you will find sign-up bonuses of up to $100,000 on the best exchanges,
as well as 50% trading fee discounts and 75% cash back on deposits.
These deals are only available to Coin Bureau viewers and will not be around for long.
So, take advantage of them ASAP using the link down below or this QR code.
Back to the vid.
Okay, now that you understand what L2s are,
let's take a look at one of the largest ones by Total Value Locked, or TVL.
In first place is Arbitrum, an optimistic roll-up created by off-chain labs in 2019.
Its mainnet went live in September 2021,
and the ARB governance token was launched in March 2023.
Arbitrum is essentially an ecosystem of scaling solutions
that let developers build dApps and roll-up chains.
It has four main components, starting with Arbitrum One, its flagship optimistic roll-up.
Arbitrum One supports Ethereum smart contracts
and works with all of Ethereum's developer tools.
The second component is Arbitrum Nitro,
which is a tech stack for developers to use to build orbit chains,
which are technically layer 3s, but let's not go there.
The third component is Arbitrum Stylus,
which allows developers to build EVM-compatible smart contracts
using coding languages like Rust, C, and C++.
Rather than just Solidity, which is of course the coding language used for Ethereum's smart contracts.
And the fourth is Arbitrum Nova, which is itself an orbit chain.
Arbitrum Nova is faster and cheaper than Arbitrum One,
making it better for things like blockchain gaming and social media,
albeit with some centralization trade-offs.
And these features have made Arbitrum the top Ethereum layer 2 by TVL,
and it seems to be also emerging as a top layer 2 for GameFi.
And that's because building blockchain games is much easier
since devs can code without learning Solidity thanks to Arbitrum Stylus.
And this lets devs build immersive games with cool features worth play to earn,
with instant payouts and ownable NFTs that work across different games.
And most importantly, Arbitrum Nova's high throughput and low costs
keep those games running smoothly.
Accessing Arbitrum chains, including Nova, is pretty easy.
Just go to Arbitrum.io and click Bridge and Explore.
There you'll see two buttons, Bridge and Portal.
Bridge brings you to an interface that lets you transfer funds to Arbitrum.
And you'll also need to add the Arbitrum network to a wallet-like metamask.
But the Bridge does this automatically, so no manual setup is required.
Clicking Portal takes you to the dashboard where Arbitrum says
there are over 1000 apps built on its network.
And what's great is that you can sort these by categories
like DeFi, AI, Deepin, Gaming, NFTs and many more.
Exploring these projects is a great way to find promising tokens
with serious upside potential.
But what about Arbitrum's own ARB token?
Well, even with the most recent altcoin rally,
ARB is still about 80% below its all-time high of $2.40,
at least at the time of shooting.
As such, returning to that level roughly translates to a 5x gain from today's prices.
However, we believe that ARB could be significantly undervalued.
As more investors move further down the risk curve,
many will be drawn to Arbitrum since it's currently Ethereum's largest layer too.
As such, we reckon a conservative estimate for ARB would be somewhere around $4,
roughly 8x up from today's prices.
Okay, the second largest L2 by TVL is Base, another optimistic roll-up chain.
Base was launched by the Coinbase Exchange in August 2023.
Unlike other L2s in today's video, though,
Base doesn't have its own native token, and we'll come back to that in a bit.
Since launch, Base has become one of the most popular Ethereum blockchains,
and that's because it's more efficient than many other L2s,
even outperforming Arbitrum 1 by some metrics.
But obviously, what's really driven adoption is its integration with Coinbase.
Now, it's important to note that Coinbase recently began transitioning its wallet app
into its Base app, which is still in development, but should be available in most countries.
And if you already have the wallet, then don't worry, it still works as usual.
But as the Base app, it's becoming an all-in-one platform for trading,
posting, chatting with friends, and even sending money globally for free.
Since the Base L2 is such a major player in the Ethereum ecosystem,
it supports hundreds, if not thousands, of projects.
So, how do you spot the ones with potential?
Well, one way is to head on over to CoinMarketCap, then click on the categories,
and sort the list alphabetically, and scroll down to Base Ecosystem.
From there, you can filter these options by different narratives,
and if you watched our recent video on how to find 100x altcoins before they pump,
you'll know that some of the hottest narratives on Base include
memecoins, tokenized RWAs, and AI agents, among others.
And you can learn more about how to find these 100x altcoins before they pump
by watching our video on that right over here.
Now, as we mentioned earlier, there is currently no native Base token,
and what's more, is that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Base founder Jesse Pollock
have repeatedly insisted that there isn't going to be one.
The most recent example of this was in April this year,
after someone tokenized a Coinbase tweet.
And, well, let's just say it didn't perform so well.
Soon after, Coinbase responded by stating that this wasn't an official token,
and there are no plans to create one either.
We were previously more skeptical and thought that a native token might still be on the cards.
But now, we think if it were going to happen, it probably would already have happened.
Launching a major token mid-bull market isn't really the best strategy,
since prices would almost definitely crash soon afterwards.
For what it's worth, though, Coinbase stock seems to have been benefiting from Base the L2 itself.
Okay, the third largest layer 2 by TVL is the OP Mainnet, also known as Optimism.
As the former name would suggest, the OP Mainnet uses optimistic roll-up technology.
Optimism began as the Plasma Group back in January 2019 before rebranding a year later.
Optimism's Mainnet launched in December 2021.
And what makes OP Mainnet unique is its Superchain,
which aims to unite the fragmented L2 space into one big interoperable ecosystem.
And you can easily track its chains and projects at superchain.eco.
We'll drop a link in the description for you to come back and check it later.
You can access OP Mainnet through a compatible Web3 wallet like Metamask,
Coinbase Wallet, or Trust Wallet by first adding the Optimism network.
If you're using Metamask, the OP Mainnet will already be available for you to add within the app.
If this isn't an option for you, though, you'll need to add the network yourself.
An easy way to do this is by visiting chainlist.org,
which we'll also leave a link to for you guys in the description.
Simply search for OP Mainnet, connect your wallet, and the chain will be added automatically.
Then, to bridge funds, OP Mainnet suggests two options.
Bred.gg and SuperBridge.
Both will do the same thing, but we like the SuperBridge's super simplistic UI,
so we've gone for that right now.
Simply connect your wallet and the amount of ETH you want to bridge to OP Mainnet,
and then you'll see the range of options.
Using the native bridge has no extra fees, but takes about 3 minutes, which isn't too bad.
Alternatively, you can select much faster options that charge a small fee,
like the Across protocol.
When we tried, these options cut the wait time to 8 seconds for just a fraction of a cent.
Once that's set up, you'll probably want to start looking for up-and-coming projects within
OP Mainnet's ecosystem.
To do this, head to the superchain.eco website that we mentioned a moment ago.
The Chains and Projects button will help reveal some potential candidates.
The Chains tab lists quite a few blockchains, but Projects offers a much wider variety.
And what's great is that the Projects tab has an inbuilt filter,
so you can select specific categories, aka different niches.
For example, selecting SocialFi narrows the list to 21 different projects,
at least at the time of shooting.
But what about OP Mainnet's own native OP token?
Well, at the time of shooting, OP is still down 85% from its previous all-time high of $4.85.
And this means that rallying back to this level would translate to a more than 6x gain
from today's prices.
Now, we reckon that OP could actually rally much further than this,
and a conservative estimate would be around $8.50, so about 10x from here.
Now, the fourth largest Ethereum layer 2 by TVL is Unichain,
a relative newcomer from Uniswap Labs, which launched Uniswap,
the leading Ethereum DEX, way back in 2018.
Uniswap's native Uni token was launched in September 2020,
but Unichain's Mainnet only went live this February.
If you check out Unichain's website, you'll see it describes itself as,
quote, the home for DeFi.
From the site, you can also access Unichain by clicking the Bridge to Unichain button.
This will open up the Uniswap DEX with Unichain ETH already preselected as the asset.
To bridge your ETH over to Uniswap, connect any compatible Web3 wallet.
We actually think Uniswap's Wallet app is actually pretty good,
and even has a few handy features like custom usernames and keyboard shortcuts to name but a few.
Once that's set up, you can easily bridge funds to Unichain by swapping your regular ETH for
Unichain ETH.
To discover promising projects on Unichain, head back to the website
and scroll down to the Start Exploring section.
You'll see that it has, quote, more than 100 apps and infrastructure building on Unichain,
with a button right below labeled Explore Apps and Integrations.
Go ahead and click it.
You should see a long list of every project in the Unichain ecosystem.
At the time of shooting, there were over 179 projects to explore.
The good news is that there's a handy filter that lets you narrow your search by specific
DeFi use cases.
For example, if you pick Lending, the list shrinks down to just four projects.
Much easier, right?
Now, what about Uni, the native token for both Unichain and Uniswap?
Well, as we record this, Uni is around 75% down from its all-time high of almost $45.
And this means that returning to that level would translate to a roughly 4x gain from here.
Again though, we believe that Uni can surpass this target.
As Ethereum continues to gain traction, more and more investors will begin exploring DeFi
and ERC-20 tokens, both of which channel capital into Uniswap.
And this could significantly drive Uni's price up.
And we reckon a conservative estimate would be for around $80 for the Uni token,
and 8x from today's prices.
Now, the fifth largest Ethereum layer 2 by TVL is ZKSync, which is the only one in today's list
that doesn't use optimistic rollups as a scale-in solution.
Instead, as the name would suggest, it uses zero-knowledge proofs,
which, as you'll recall from earlier in the video,
can process transactions based on a portion of the transaction data,
making transactions faster and cheaper.
In any case, ZKSync was originally founded by Matter Labs in 2018.
In late 2019, Matter Labs revealed its plans for ZKSync,
and the first version of it launched on mainnet in June 2020.
The current version, version 2.0, also known as ZKSync era, was launched in March 2023.
The platform's native ZK token was then launched in June 2024.
ZKSync is a major player in the tokenized RWA niche, second only to Ethereum.
At the time of shooting, Ethereum commands about 55% of the RWA market share,
while ZKSync holds around 18%, excluding stablecoins.
And what's crazy is that ZKSync's dominance far exceeds other competitors,
like Aptos, Solana, and Stellar, all of which have a market share of 4% or less.
As you'll have guessed already, you can access ZKSync by connecting any compatible Web3 wallet,
and then adding the network to your wallet.
If you're using Metamask, you should see that ZKSync is already available
as a network you can add within the app.
Alternatively, you can easily do this yourself by visiting the chainlist.org website.
Just type in ZKSync and you should see the mainnet pop up.
Connect your wallet and the ZKSync network will be added automatically.
You can then bridge your funds by visiting portal.zksync.io.
We should of course point out though that this bridge is currently in beta
at the time of shooting, but for what it's worth, we didn't experience any issues.
Connect your wallet, type in how much ETH you want to bridge to ZKSync, and then click continue.
You can find promising projects within the ZKSync ecosystem by checking out
ZKSync's official website. That's because ZKSync also has a similar concept to
OP mainnet's superchain. ZKSync calls this the elastic network,
which consists of 19 different blockchains, all powered by ZKSync technology.
Of course, you can go through each of these 19 chains to find a narrative that could do well,
but given ZKSync's overwhelming market share of the RWA niche, it could be a good idea to narrow
the list down to projects that also support RWAs. Not financial advice, of course.
In any case, there is just one final question remaining.
What about ZKSync's native ZK token? Well, at the time of shooting, ZK is around 80%
down from its all-time high of 32 cents. Reaching this level again would then be a gain of about
roughly five times from today's prices. But as you'll probably know, the RWA niche is one
with serious potential, so it won't be surprising to hear that we think this target is easy to beat.
From our perspective, a conservative estimate would be somewhere around 50 cents or higher,
which would be around 10x from today's prices. And that's our rundown of the largest Ethereum
layer 2s. Of course, Ethereum's L2 universe extends far beyond the ones we've talked about
here, so let us know which other L2s are on your radar in the comments down below. Which ones are
we sleeping on? And which ones should we cover in the future? And if you want to see how high
ETH could go in this upcoming rally, then check out our video right over here. And if you're not
subscribed to the channel yet, you can do that right over here. Thank you all very much for
watching and I'll see you the next time. This is Nick, over and out.
