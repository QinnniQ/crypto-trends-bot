Features

Live market data via CoinGecko API (price, 24h change, etc.)

Multiple tools in one agent (retrieval + market data fetching)

Conversational interface in the terminal

Designed for expansion â€” add more tools, more data sources, or a web UI

How it Works
Ingest expert crypto content into a Chroma vector database

Use LangChain to retrieve relevant chunks for a userâ€™s query
