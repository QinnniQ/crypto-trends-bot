    "text": "This is huge. 401(k)s manage over 8 trillion, and a big part of the S&P 500‚Äôs rise is likely due to constant inflows from these pensions. If they now allow crypto, real estate or private equity, the same automatic buying pressure could inflate those assets just like it did with the index.\n\nMost people underestimate the effect that passive flows have on asset prices. When money goes into a 401(k), it does not sit still. It gets allocated automatically in many cases into predefined funds. The most common destination is broad index funds, especially those tracking the S&P 500. That means, regardless of whether Apple, Microsoft or Nvidia are overvalued, money keeps flowing in and buying them simply because they are large and part of the index. The result is a feedback loop. Prices go up because people are buying, and people are buying because their retirement plans are designed to do it for them. No analysis, no valuation check, just mechanical flows repeating every month.\n\nThis mechanism has created years of steady upward pressure on the biggest names in the market. Many investors believe they are diversified just because they are in an index fund, but in reality they are mostly exposed to the same top companies that dominate the index by weight. This is not a free market dynamic, it is a system driven by design and regulation.\n\nNow imagine if even a small percentage of that eight trillion starts flowing into alternative assets. The effect could be dramatic. These are markets with lower liquidity and much smaller capitalizations compared to the S&P 500. If crypto becomes accessible through 401(k)s, the amount of new demand could push prices far beyond current levels. The same goes for private equity and real estate investment funds. The demand does not need to be huge to cause a reaction. When money flows in consistently without regard for valuation, price becomes a function of flow, not fundamentals.\n\nIt also changes perception. When something becomes eligible inside a 401(k), it gains legitimacy. People who would never open a crypto wallet or invest in private equity may now consider it just because it is part of their retirement plan. That opens the door to wider adoption and even more inflows. We could be at the start of a new cycle, where assets that were once considered too risky or too exotic start behaving like traditional investments simply because the structure forces buying over time.\n\nThis kind of structural change is not just a regulatory footnote. It has the power to reshape markets completely. If the same mechanism that inflated the S&P 500 is applied to other asset classes, expect the same outcome. Passive, automatic, price-insensitive buying will find its next targets.",

    "text": "Hi! Maybe some of you already know me, I am one of the **Reddit Collectible Avatars \"Artist\"** (big quotes because I am still a noob üòÖ). I started my journey in May 2024 and it started because Reddit opened the program for \"everyone\" (country restrictions apply) and I was looking to resurrect an old hobby like drawing so I decided to learn Illustrator for my first sketch made with pencil and paper and then bought a cheap iPad to create them with ProCreate.\n\nLooking back, I am really happy with this decision, I has been a fun ride, drawing things I love (within Reddit's guidelines) and being part of this incredible RCA ecosystem. The community here is genuinely one of the most supportive I have seen on the Internet.\n\nAnd to top it off, I have even made some money from it, not \"buy a lambo\" money but a solid **‚Ç¨150 to ‚Ç¨400** just from doing something I enjoy in my free time!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9bttdoqpclhf1.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=da27a0d445c37fbb82f42b2146b6e1cade099599\n\nIf you are new you are probably wondering what **Reddit Collectible Avatars (RCAs)** are. They are customizable Reddit profile avatars with swappable traits (like outfits, backgrounds, accessories, etc.) Think of it like Mr. Potato Head but digital and way cooler because there are more possibilities. It is all about creativity and expression.\n\nAnother great perk is that you don't need to be a pro artist or crypto wizard to join in. Reddit made the process quite easy and accessible. Yes, there is a little curve at first but once you figure it out it is easy peazy.\n\nTo give an idea of how it is going, I release about 1-2 avatars per month (I try to be in the Reddit shop events), nothing crazy. Some have higher mint numbers like 150, others less but I could say that many of them sell consistently in fact. You can see in the following charts % sold for each of my drops.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04m3z4drclhf1.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26043f2b84003f68c701aea0987709ecda4b099\n\nJust wanted to share my experience about this amazing Reddit program that a lot of users on Reddit doesn't know about.\n\nCome for the art, stay for the vibes.\n\n**Here you can find more information about the program:**\n\n* Program Guide: [https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/sections/14132723188244-Collectible-Avatars-Creator-Program](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/sections/14132723188244-Collectible-Avatars-Creator-Program)\n* Shop: [https://www.reddit.com/avatar/shop](https://www.reddit.com/avatar/shop)",

He compares Ethereum's current moment to Bitcoin's supposed \"ChatGPT moment\" in 2017, which marked a turning point in Bitcoin's adoption.

For employers paying remote staff, or businesses sourcing materials globally, this shift has introduced faster, cheaper, and more predictable financial rails.\n\nOne site I came across recently, [Stablecoin Insider](https://stablecoininsider.com), has been tracking the rise of stablecoin adoption and publishing some pretty insightful coverage including updates on which platforms support stablecoin payouts, regulatory shifts in different regions, and use cases across industries. It‚Äôs been helpful for staying current with this side of the ecosystem that often gets overshadowed by memecoins and speculation.\n\nIt‚Äôs interesting to see how 2025 might be the tipping point where stablecoins stop being seen just as trading tools, and start becoming infrastructure.

So, here is why I think it is like 99% sure shot to win.\n1) BTC is 115k today, which is 35k away from 150k.\n2) There are only about 87 days from today until Oct 31, 2025.\n3) In order for BTC to get from 115k to 150k, BTC would have to rise by +30% in 87 days.\n4) BTC market cap is +2.6 TRILLION\n5) In order to get to 150k, BTC would need to gain +168 Billion in market cap in only 87 days.\n6) There is pretty much NO chance 160Billion of liquidity is coming into BTC in the next 87 days from retail or anywhere else. If that was possible, BTC would be at 4 trillion by Nov 1st, 2025. There is no way that is happening.\n7) This leads me to believe that no matter how much $ you have, if you bet it all against BTC reaching 150k before Nov 1st, 2025, you have like a 99% chance at winning.\nTherefore, Im testing my theory by betting $400 to only get back $500 ($100 profit).\n\nNote: I am waiting to see if the prices get better so I can buy more.\n",

I have days of TxnHash confirmations of this, and the WBTC in my wallet has the same contract address it always did.\n\nUnichain also appears to make it impossible to bridge any crypto other than ETH back to the mainnet (please correct me if I'm wrong)...which means I'm stuck.\n\nWhen I attempt to trade the WBTC, Uniswap throws the error, \"This swap may fail.\"\n\nIt looks like this: [https://imgur.com/a/2ThfzVN](https://imgur.com/a/2ThfzVN)\n\nNotice that Uniswap makes no attempt at calculating a network fee - which, as I understand, they would do if this error was about preventing paying for a swap that was likely to fail.\n\nThis is the closest error I can find in their docs:\n\n[https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/23334343679501-Error-message-Transaction-is-expected-to-fail](https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/23334343679501-Error-message-Transaction-is-expected-to-fail)\n\nHOWEVER, Unichain ETH still swaps just fine.  This appears to be specific to WBTC.\n\nI've reached out to support and they're unresponsive/generally so abusive to their users that it should be criminal.  DeFi is supposed to work so that we don't have to interact with gatekeepers who steal our money, but all their a16z funding has made them more of the same (but that's a conversation for another time).  Merkl has been similarly terrible - fees they say I've earned are disappearing from the dash.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this Unichain issue?  Any idea how it can be resolved?

    "text": "An opinion piece by Alec Beckman, Co-Founder and President of Advantage Blockchain, argues that Ethereum is fulfilling Bitcoin‚Äôs original vision as outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs white paper of being a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. The article notes that Bitcoin has evolved into a store of value, often compared to digital gold and a macro asset, but struggles with volatility, slow scaling, and rigidity, making it less suitable for electronic cash. In contrast, Ethereum‚Äôs programmability enables stablecoins like USDC and USDT, which settle trillions in peer-to-peer value 24/7 without bank intermediaries, rivaling major credit and debit card networks ([Visa On-Chain Analytics](https://visaonchainanalytics.com/transactions)). The piece highlights Ethereum‚Äôs role in real-world asset tokenization (RWAs), with institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton building on Ethereum, not Bitcoin, and enabling native yield through staking for network security and returns. It positions Ethereum as quietly gaining institutional market share, fulfilling Bitcoin‚Äôs vision of a decentralized, global financial system with open access and programmable trust, with further details in Advantage Blockchain‚Äôs last quarterly report ([Advantage Blockchain Report](http://advantageblockchain.com/report)).",

    "text": "In his keynote at ETHAsia 2025, Vitalik Buterin outlined a forward-looking roadmap for Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 1 (L1) blockchain, emphasizing scalability improvements, the evolving interplay between L1 and L2 solutions, and user-centric innovations like account abstraction. Delivered during the 2025 Hong Kong Web3 Carnival, the speech underscored Ethereum‚Äôs ambition to become a secure and efficient \"world computer\" capable of supporting diverse, large-scale applications. Ethereum‚Äôs current transaction throughput stands at 15 transactions per second (TPS) on L1 and approximately 250 TPS on L2, reflecting significant progress in L2 scaling.¬†\n\nButerin proposed applying L2‚Äôs scaling strategies‚Äîspecifically leveraging the asymmetry between transaction production and verification‚Äîto L1. This approach, outlined in Attachment 2 (\"What if we scale L1 further?\"), would allow L1 to process more transactions and data, enhancing its scalability. He emphasized that while L2 adoption grows, L1 must remain robust to perform critical functions, particularly during L2 failures. Buterin stressed the need for continuous improvement of both L1 and L2, advocating diverse development approaches‚Äîincluding AI-based methods‚Äîto prepare Ethereum for mainstream adoption. His ultimate goal is to position L1 as the secure, decentralized core of a \"world computer,\" supporting a robust ecosystem of applications with high efficiency and resilience.\n\n",
